utterly worthless objection,

Wyclif’s :inswer very briefly, There are various kinds of priority7 :imongst
which priority in time :ind origin are most important. Α sound is prior in
its origin to the tune ol which it forms a part, yet it is not prior to it

without one, when is it sormless? Never, in time3 but it is so1·n·1less at what
Wyclif calls the lirst instant of nature -- a mode osbeing, not measured
by time. What under-lies anything must exist (at least in its nature] before

the various senses of this term. The same essence is matter, form and
eompound, i. e it consists of these three, just as God consists of the
Three Persons, without eeasing to be perfectly simple. The difference is
in the point of view you take. The essence of man, of that which is man,

Clz. 7. (pp. 216—205) consists mainly of the same objections as
were given before, this time answered by an appeal to the ssible and
Augusfflue, whose expressions coincide with the theory set forth. Itis not
of much interest, for the opponent's answer would be ready: neither the
inspired authors nor the Father of the Chureh intended to write with
Scholastic exavtness, However, the argument, confirmed by a great number
of quotations7 seems to thow that Wyclis⁷s theory agrees more closely
with the letter of Holy Writ. Two points may be noted here. One that
Wyclif approves of a theologian, who, to avoid sophistical affectation‚
would answer simply ires and [ιω to the sanie question; of course in
disserent senses. This, lu· says, is 2111 affective mode of reasoning‚ but
with cavillers only. The other is that our author finds himself contradieted
by Aristode. The latter says: “A statue is made of brass; brass is not
made u stutue.'’ But Wychf, quoting· ‘the water that was made wine'7 and
Adam who was ‘dust', and many other passages of a like nature, merely

replies that he does not appi-ove Aristotle's dicium.
