each mental act depends, then each of these acts is independent, and can
be conceived as self-existing. What these philosophers take away from
the Subject‚ they must give to the acts, it is impossible to conceive a
a feeling neither independent and sels-existing, nor dependent on another
being distinct from it —— a feeling which neither feels itself, nor is felt
by a something which is not that feeling. On the other hand, Wyclif tells
us (p. 2) that there was another school which asserted that the feelings‚
thoughts, &Q were identical with Mind3 and this would correspond closely
enough to the position of those who contend that Mind is the sum
or series of experiences of any individual‚ and that the individual is not
different from his experiences: which in its result amounts to the same
doctrine as the one just stated. He himself, though he does not state it
clearly at first, is of opinion that the mind is to its mental acts as the
active thing is to its action, or as a mobile to its motion (see pp. 38—41):
the second different, but inseparable from the first, and absolutely unthink—
able without it. And thus the question is now as actual as it ever wasg
and all the advances of science, how great soever they may have been, have
done nothing to solve the problem — as indeed they could do nothing,
because they belong to another sphere. This question, ifit can be solved⁷ must
be solved only by Metaphysical arguments. It is worth seeing what Wyclif
has contributed to a discussion so important and of such actual interest.

Those who admit that thought is an action of the thinking mind,
yet try to conceive it as separable therefrom and possibly existing apart,
fall into sels-contradiction. Admitting for the present that a quality can
exist without its subject, how can quality be at the same time actz'zrity
ψ. 2‡)? We classify sensations according to their objects, which if present
produce the corresponding acts: between the mind and the object no
intervening quality is needed (p. 3‘). If the will to move, for instance,
were an absolute quality, existing throughout the body, the same move-
ment would be produced in every part of it: which is absurd. And
difference in the organs cannot make the difference in the movements,
since they all obey the will, and this obedience‚ if will were such a
quality as conceived, would make a man able to do anything he chose
to will <P- - 35). Then, as to the acts of the mind·⁷ they are true, false,
particular, universal, etc, but an absolute entity is a thing. and a thing
must be true, must be concrete. If you have to posit an act distinct

from the mind, to enable it to think of its object, why not posit another
