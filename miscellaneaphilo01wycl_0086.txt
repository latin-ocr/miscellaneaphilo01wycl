LXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

Essence that is identical with the Father and the Son, who are themselves
distinct Pcrsons; the Word that is God and Man at once, although Deity
is not humanity3 and Universal Humansty, which is identical with Peter and
with Paul, though Peter and Paul are different individuals. Therefore, if
I say: ‘This same essence will be fire and will be water’, it does not
follow that lire will be water. Wyclif then goes on to examine various
changes, a discussion into which we need not enter, since his system
explains all of them except Transubstantiatiom and he admits that there
is here a question which he has not yet solved. Had he admitted that
his Subject had a merely logical existence, there would have been no
difficulty here at all. That which was bread is Christ's Body. That which,
the subject of the change, remains of course, even in the orthodox
explanation, but it is a mere word that stands, now for bread‚ now for
Christ’s ssody But Wyclif‚ in his Realism, was constrained to give the
sentence the following signification: leal identically same real thing which
was bread is the Body of Christ. And the Church had decided that
nothing remained of the bread save the outward appearances. Could these
be taken as the underlying subject? Was the subject merely the same
space, occupied by the appearances? and if so, could he grant that the
space had a real existence of its own, without coming into conflict with
the Church? No wonder that at this stage Wyclif avoided the discussion,
and said: “Est longus sermo, et adhuc mihi inscrutabilis’' (p. 186—189).

The rest of the chapter (pp. 189—196) is devoted to a discussion
of creation⁷ in the course of which Wyclif says that the essence of things
existed before the things themselves (an assertion that he will explain
and justify further on); of the objection that, the receptivity of matter being
a perfection‚ the subject cannot be conceived as formless, to which he
replies that bare receptivity of anything cannot be a form, since a form
must determine a subject to be this or that in particular3 and of the vestiges
of the Trinity in creation. We now see clearly that anything for which
a concrete term is made to stand, v. g. man, horse, tree, is in Wyclif's
theory, the complete substance. What answers to the corresponding abstract
terms‚ humanity, ‘equinity'7 ‘arboreity', is the form. And that which is
either a horse, or a man, or a tree, is the subject or matter, which may
be identically the same in each successively, as it is the same in nature
for all of them simultaneously. And if we are yet more curious to know

what this matter may be, we shall find, on reverting to Logica‚ that it is
