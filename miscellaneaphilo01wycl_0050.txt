baim :md here Wy‹:lif is content to give his opponents the first innings.

“What is contingent 31 any time cannot become necessary. It is
not necessary 11131 Ι exist nowg Ι 6311 conceive my not existi11g; there-
fore Ι cau conceive my ‘not having existed yesterslay'. What could
make this necessary? what could change the nature of a 601111113611111111117
and pass over the infinite distance which separates Contingency ,froin
necessity? 'l‘he (1611131 os such a truth in the past is salse indeed, but
not unthinlznlfle, 33 11 should be in Wyclif's theory. We can argue con-
sistently from such 3 (1611131 33 31116111136ῑ 11 cannot therefore be absurd,
for the Absurd is defined 33 that from which anything⁷ true or false⁷
may follow, if it be posited, As we say of things present that they are7
so we say of things past that they are possibleg and if what is may be
otherwise 30 what 1133 been may possibly have been otherwise. If God has
infinite power over the present, he has no less over the past3 if He can
prevent things happening nour, He can also make them not to have
taken place. Even inan 6311 (10 that. If we say that we might have done

Wyclif <proceeding here according to the plan of St. Thomas in
his Summa leeologiccz) next gives his own arguments on the contrary
side, and winds up by refuting those of the adversary. Whatever 13 30
true that it cannot 66336 10 be true, is necessary; and this 13 1116 6336
with things 11131 have happened in the Past. God Himself cannot restore
lost virginity. The Past 13 immutably what it isg and therefore its truth
is necessary. If the same thing could happen again. the return ofadead
man to life would be no iniracle. Any singular proposition referring to
a sact may 1)6 known 33 eternally and therefore necessarily 1136111111)-
should we take thought for the future, if we can make the past not to
have been? Here the adversaries say 111317 speaking of possibilityy they
abstract from time: 3 111311 who is blind might be not blind, and may
