LXXII INTRODUCTION.

author — is quoted at length in De Materia et Forma (p. 1715. Resides,
the works of Wyclif himself are quoted or mentioned, always, as usual
with him, without saying whose works they are; so much so, that in
De Actibus Anime his allusion (p. 12) to libro tercio without any mention
of the author would naturally lead us to suppose he is speaking of a
work os his own. De Ydeis, De Trinitate, De Benedicta lucar-nacione,
De Tempore, and De Universalibzts‚ are all spoken of as either already
known or as about to appear: and this last is no doubt the strongest
proof of authenticity that can be given.

As to the date, we may fix it approximately by the tractates above
mentioned. All save De Benedicta- Incarnacione are referred to as already
written3 this one alone is to come. Now Mr Harris, in his Introduction
to this work, gives an extremely ingenious argument to assign for its
appearance one of the years between 1363 and 1367. De Materia et
Forma came before it, and the whole Summa de Eizte before that, since
Wyclif refers to treatises in the Summa, and even to some of the treatises
which stand last upon the Vienna list. De composicione Hominis, from its
references (pp. 10, 14) to De Universalihus, must have been written after
that treatise, and also, in all probability, after the Samium and as it is
the development and application of the doctrine contained in De Μαίενία
et Forma, it was most likely written after it. De Ente Predicamenlali is
certainly posterior to the Summa, from which it quotes, but Ι have found
in it no quotation either from the present treatise or from De Composi-
cione Hominis, If we admit Buddensieg's date of 1362 for that of Wyclif’s
denial of annihilation (towards which our author near the end of Logica
is evidently strongly inclined) these works come in the following order⁷
so far as I can judge, (1) The ten long tractates of the Summa de Ente.
(2) De Enle Predicamenlali. (3) De Materia el Forma. (4) De· Composi-
cione Hominis,· and (5) De Benedicta J11cm·naci0ne‚· not to speak of the
Questiowes 13 which seem to have belonged to an earlier period. It seems
impossible for a man to have written so much in less than five years;
therefore, if 1367 be really the latest date for De Izzcarnacione, Ι would
also incline to think it not far from the earliest, and since De Compasi<
cione Hominis and De lllaz‘eria et Forma are both short treatises, to
suppose them written one year before; let us say, in 1366 or 1365. And
even that would give us only four or six-e years for his immense work
De Ense, together with the one. that immediately followed it. This outpour
