INDEX.

Matter, Aristotle's definition of, 185 and
note,· primal matter is successively
fire, earth, etc., 216, 2173 this is
proved by Scripture, 217—2203 to the
objection that then no substance would
ever begin or cease to be, the answer
is that all things were created together
in their essenceS, 221, 222, but not
the compounds themselves, 222, 2233
for the union of matter with form has
its beginning in time, 2233 that which
began with time may be called cor-
ruptible or not as we please, in diffe-
rent senses, which is a good way to
answer sophists‚ 223, 2243 this doc-
trine being in agreement with Scrip-
ture, Aristotle is wrong where he con-
tradicts it, 2243 Scriptural expressions
are literally true in Wyclif's doctrine,
225: and it would by no means con-
fuse the persons of the Trinity, ib„-
that primal matter is never formless
does not prove that it has no entity
of its own, 226; we can only say it
has no form by itself, and therefore
itsnature is formless‚ though it re-
quires a form to exist, 227. Objection
that every creature exists eternally in
God, and yet the non-existence of the
world is eternally known to be true,
228; to which we may either reply
that ‘non-existence' does not contradict
the idea of possible entity, but actual
existence only, 228, 2293 or that there
never was or will be any such thing
as absolute non-existence, 230—2323
God's knowledge of the world as
non-existing is not absolute, since
the world is now, and from all
eternity was about to be; 232, 233;
God does not see the being of that
which is not, but sees it to be pos-
sible, 234.

Mental acts are universally admitted to
exist, 1; three theories concerning thern,
23 some say they are qualities, some,
the soul itself, some, an accident of
the genus ‘quality’, ib.,· these acts do
not necessarily imply movement, 35,
and are merely the subject qud per-
ceiving, in Wyclif's view, 36.
