INTRODUCTION. LXIII

At the end of the eighth (leaf 74):
“rosumyej”.
And aster “Explicit ..... Vycleph’':
“O Wycleff Wycleff negednomu ty hlawu zwycless‘’ i. e.
“O wichs, Wiclif upon many hast thou exercised witl‘’
IV. In the Fourth Treatise: “Replicacio de vniversalibus'‘ are no
Bohernian words,
V. In the Fifth Treatise “de veris vniversalibus'‘ occur the following:
At the end os Ch. 3 (leaf 94) in red ink:
“Za zlaty stogy czos slyssal’' i. e.
“What thou hast heard may be pricecl in gold”.
Before Ch. 5 (leaf 955 in red:
“hurtyk’'.
Before Ch. 8 tleaf 1025:
“haha niemczy haha” i. e. “I-laha, Germans! Hahal’'
Before Ch. ΙΙ (leaf 1165:
“znamenay czos §lyssal'’ i. e. “Mark what thon hast heardl’‘
Before Ch. 13 (leaf 124‘):
“Myly Wycleph dayt boh nebeske kralewstwye’' i. e.
“Dear Wyclif‚ may God give to thee the kingdom of heavenl”
In Ch. 13 (leaf 126) in the fourth sentence “quando sit distinccio'’
after the word “arguenda’' is written in red ink
“hrdyna’' 1 i. e. “hero''
but it has apparently no connexion with the text. Lastly at the end of
this treatise and of the MS. (leaf134) after the words “Explicit . . &c‚’'
is added in red ink:
“Amen tal< boh clay'’ i. e.

“Amen7 may God so grant!”

(2). Authenticity and date of the Work.

As we see, Pastor LundstrOm comes to the conclusion, on one
hand7 that it is very doubtful whether Replicacio cle Universalihus was
written by Huss, and on the other that “it is quite credible” that Wyclif
wrote it. Ι must for my own part and without the slightest doubt assert

1 Thus the MS, Dr, Dudik has wrongly “hrdina”.
