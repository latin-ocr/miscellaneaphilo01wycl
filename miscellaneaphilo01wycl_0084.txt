LXXVI INTRODUCTION.

Ch. 2. Here Wyclit treats 01 Ideal forms, which are the patterns of
all things⁷ existing etei-nally in God. Neither here nor elsewhere have Ι
been able to find ont whether the Universal Man —— who according to
him exists really and eternally in God, really and temporally in each 01
1115 singulars ——* is something distinct from the Divine Idea of man, or not.
It may be that Wyclif considers the pattern to be something different
from the reality created according to that pattern3 but then he would have
to admit an eternally created being. Or again, he may have thought that
the Universal Man, quei existing in God’s mind, is the pattern of the same,
qud existing in singulars: but then there would be no real difference
between the two. I must therefore confine myself to expounding his
doctrine, as he sets it forth.

There is in God an innumerable multitude of ideal forms7 one with
Him in essenee, though we may think of them as distinct from Him; and
in this sense He is the Form of all beings. He is Himself the Form of
the Three divine Persons⁷ since Deity is common to all Three7 and since
the Three Persons are not distinct subjects, they are all Three one
infinite Form. But sometimes the term is applied to the Person 01 the
Word. Form emanates from matter, in created things, and the compound
proceeds from both together3 thus the Son emanates from the Father‚ and
the Holy Ghost likewise proceeds from them. And this Supreme Formis
the exemplar of all things. Conceive the world as a mere receptivity‚ a
something that by itself would at once ssow away into nonentity‚ and God
present everywhere, giving to all things all their qualities of goodneSS,
beauty and perfection (pp. 170——175). This comparison might easily be
understood in a Pantheistic sense3 those perfections we see in the world,
are they not the very perfections of God? But Wyclif here⁷ and indeed
throughout 1115 life, refuses to admit this conclusion7 and we find him
(p. 176) saying distinctly that God “forms outside 01 1111115611 and makes
the beauty (formositatem) 01 every creature''. We may think we 566 a
necessary Pantheistic tendency in the whole of this doctrine3 but Wyelif
certainly did not see it; and no doubt be understood his own system
better than we.

Olz. 3. Our author here begins to join issue with the Sehool. A sub-
stantial form is7 according to him, a form 111 the widest and most abstract
sense in which the term was used: that by which anything is what it 15.
