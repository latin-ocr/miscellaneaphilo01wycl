XXXIV INTRODUCTION.

work is purely metaphysical in its aim and in most 01 1116 questions
dealt with. It is in two parts3 the first (pp. 1—58) has three chapters,
one of which (pp. 1—34) attacks the theory that mental acts are things
distinct from the mind3 the second (pp. 34—38) is a summary 01 1116
arguments in favour of the position that such acts 316 qualities (which,
it would appear, some philosophers understood as being separable
entities); and the third (pp. 38—58) is consecrated to the refutation of
these arguments. The second part (pp. 59—128) is in four chapters‚
the first of which (pp, 59--87) (leals with the question whether the
mental act of affirmation, if relating to the past, must be either necessarily
true or necessarily false, The second attacks the position that no
mental act save an affirmation which implies self-contradiction can imply
absolute impossibility (pp. 87——1o5). The third (pp, 105— 116) establishes
Wyclif's theory: that God’s existence is the necessary truth on which
both possibility and impossibility depend. And the fourth (pp. 116—-128)
reverting to the theory of mental acts considered 35 (1113111165, argues
that even if they were, no quality can be an absolute accident, separable
from its substance.

First Part, Ch. I. After enumerating various mental kinds of acts
—— sensations, thought, volition and einotion -— Wyclif at once states
his view: these acts cannot be thought as entities distinct from the
mind. This discussion, of which the language is quite foreign to
that of modern metaphysicians, reveals nevertheless 3 great deal of
profound and earnest thought upon a subject closely resembling one
that has much interest for philosophers in our days3 and many of the
arguments, if stripped of their old-world form and dressed up in the
terminology of XXieth century science, would look strikingly new⁷ and
give him that used them great claims to deep and original thought3 and
Ι say this the more openly because I am perfectly aware that no one
is at all likely to grub in this mine of riches or to appropriate to him-
self what Wyclif might justly claim as his own. We well know 11131 many
metaphysicians deny the existence 01 3 Subject. For them there are only
feelings, thoughts, volitions, &03 the Subject is a mere ‘hypostatized
abstraction'. If so, they are exactly in the same position, or at least
assailable by the same kind of objections, 35 111056 who in our philo-
sopher's time gave to mental acts an entity capable of existing by

itself. If there be no underlying real Subject on which the entity of
