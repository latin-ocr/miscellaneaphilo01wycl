INTRODUCTION. LIII

With regard to the last and longest treatise Ι may say that the
writing differs very considerably from that of its predecessorS. In the first
place it is much more compressed than the others, there being now
(i. e. from leaf 87) from 45 to 47 lines to the page, whereas before we
had ouly 37 or 38. And Ι 1111151 add my opinion to that of Dudik, that
we should consider this fact as tending to show that this treatise is
written in a different hand from that of the others. Here too we have
written in red, not only the initials, but also the commas and capital
letters in the text, and besides these some of the Bohemian words (for
a list of which, see the appendix) and lastly the following sentence which
precedes the 15th chapter: “Ponam eum super tronum meum’'. In great
abundance too are the corrections, emendations of a later date and
omissions, for examples of which Dudik refers to leaves 96, 109, ΙΙΙ,
119, 120, 126, 130, 132, 133.

This treatise is followed by an index, occupying two pages of three
columns each and about half a column on a third page (leap 135 b),
and finally come eleven leaves blank and unnumbered.

We now reach the question of the authorship of these treatiseS.
There can scarcely be any real doubt, except as to Nos. ΙΙ, IV and V,
“De Ydeis''‚ “Replicacio de universalibus” and “De veris universalibus'’.
It will be remembered that an old note, according to the interpretation
of Dudik, assigns the authorship of these to Huss That Wyclifi as the
manuscript itself states -— was the author of Nos. I and III, must be
considered established beyond all doubt. But that Wyclif - and not Huss,
as this old note is supposed to 355611, — was also the author of No. V,
is evident from the concluding words of the Manuscript which I have
already quoted: “Explicit tractatus de veris universalibus Magistri venera-
bilis Johannis Wycleph, Sacre theologie veri et magni professoris, . . . .
per manus Huss de Hussinetz.

Dudik advances the very arbitrary‚ but at the same time ingenious
hypothesis that this old annotation on the cover is really intended to
mean that Huss was the author of only Nos. II and IV. The word
‘tercius' in that 6356 would be an error of the pen, and the treatises
ascribed to Huss would be “Tractatus de Ydeis and Replicacio univer-
salis eius de veris universalibus''. But with respect to this Ι must observe
that it may beconsidered quite an open question whether Dudik has
correctly interpreted this old note. The words are now to a great extent
