INTRODUCTION. XXXIII

generally accepted3 if that work had been previous to this, we can hardly,
with the knowledge of Wyclif’s readiness to refer the reader to other
tractates which had already appeared, suppose that from pp. 12 to 18,
in which he treats os vision — even in one place (p. 15,1. 25) using the
very same expression which recurs in Logica —- he purposely refrained
from referring to this important work, if it was already in existence.
Lastly, compare his words (p. 106) “Falsum est quod ego vixi 40 annis’⁷ —
which he gives as an instance, but an instance that would have no
meaning unless it were a fact, — with another example (Log. I, p, 169),
“Deus . . . potest . . . facere quod ego non sum nec fui futurus quadra-
genarius in hoc instanti;'’ and you will see that the antecedence here
is only ambiguous in so far as sum may be considered to relate to
fttlttrus, not to quadragenarius. And here again, the example that supposes
the infinite power of God to be requisite for Wyclif not to be 40 years
old at the instant he was writing, would have no meaning if the fact
were not true. We may therefore safely assign. to this work a date
anterior to 1361 but not mztclz if at all, anterior to Wyclif's Mastership
at Balliol College. Not muchg the thought is too matured for a raw
student, who began (as he tells us< somewhere) by being as strong a
Nominalist as any. Whether at all, depends on another question. Wyclif's
views‚ as expounded here, are daring enough3 but were they so daring
as to have stood in the way of his getting the Mastership at Balliol,
had they been published before? And to this question I have of course
no answer. Nominalists in authority must have been annoyed by his
arguments, but the talent he displayed may have pleased them. We
can guess now what he was aiming at all the time, and know the last
consequences to which his first principles would lead him3 but his
adversaries could not: and though we may suppose that the publication
os the book before Wyclif’s Mastership would have injured his prospects,
we cannot be sure. Nor perhaps could Wyclif; and if not⁷ who can tell
whether his caution was equal to his daring?

The title of the work prepares us to expect a tractate on Psy-
chology. But, though there undoubtedly is a great deal of psychological

argument, we should certainly be disappointed in our expectations: the
