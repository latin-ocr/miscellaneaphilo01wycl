INTRODUCTION. LXIX

holm MS. The MSS. Prag. Univ. 8. F. 1. and 8. G. 6 have already been
described in De Composicione Honn'nz’s.

The MS. 4. H. 9. of Prague University is bound in wooden boards,
with a strong leather back. Its size is abont six inches by ten. The
pagination is rather faulty3 it extends from f. 1 to f. 262. The MS. is of
paper, only the first and last outside leaves being of parchment, with half-
effaced copies of Latin verses, some of which apparently relate to the
irregular verbs. The words Pomoz mylzy boze (Help me, O God) written
in Bohemian over an erasure, sufficiently indicates the country of its
origin.

On the inside cover is an old index of contents; a newer one has
been inserted between the cover and the first (parchment) leaf. After the
parchment there is one blank leaf that is not paginated. De Universalzbus
(i. e. the treatise which is part of De Eme) follows from f. 1 to f. 52 b.
as in Shirley’s catalogue, not to f. 56 b, as marked in the MS. table of
contents. The writing is bold, legible, and probably belonging to the
carlier years of the 15 th century; and the corrections are both numerous
and carefully made. There are two columns to every page. The chapters
are indicated7 not only by red initial letters, but by numbers as well. De
Materia et Forma (beginning on f. 52 b, the number immediately following
being f. 57 -—- an error of course -- and ending f. 73 b a). De Com-
posicione Hominis (ff. 73 b a to 93 ab) and De Tempore (ff. 94 a to 115 b)
are also written in the same hand and bear a strong external resemblance
to each other. Between the two latter tracts there are, besides the verso
of s. 93 b, seven unpaginated leaves, On f. 93 b and the first of the
following leaves we find several sentences, beginning with omnixfenix est,
in another and a sprawling hand3 these are probably students’ notes. Again⁷
aster f. 113 1), come four unnumbered pages, covered with metaphysica]
figures and diagrams, probably in the same hand which made the Students'
notes. On f. 114 we have the treatise De leeis, written in the first hand,
apparently3 but now there is only one column to each page3 and this is
also the case with the tract by St. Thomas, De Encium Qm'ditatez which
follows from f. 130 b to f. 137 a. F. 137 1) and one unnumbered page
(leafll) that follows contain a prayer in German, probably in the second
<the student’s) hand, to the Blessed Sacrament. It begins: “Heiliger Gottes
leichnam ich sagf ‹lir Lob . , ,³³ From f. 138 to f. 193 we have an anti-
Wycliffian work. Conlra universalia realicz,· it begins with: “Probleuma
