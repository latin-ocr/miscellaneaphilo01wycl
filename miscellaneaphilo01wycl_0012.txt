VIII ΟΝ ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF'S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.

the woman cat7 the Felis domesticus, and the nine-tailed whip. But a
consistent Nominalist would be forced to say that we docket these with
names for the convenience of classification‚ and that equivocal terms are
just as general as terms which are univocaL since the word alone is in
both cases common to all the singularsl Now this distinction is the
basis of all reasoning; all men agree that no inference with equivocal
terms has the least value. ‘Why is the Stock Exchange like the sky?
Because there are hears in both’‚ may be meant for a joke, never for
an argument. Nominalists of course shift their ground at once, and say
that they intend to exclude fictitious resemblances3 those alone which are
natural can be admitted. Then what are and where are these resemblances?
Not in the mind alone3 therefore either in the things themselves‚· or
between them. And as they are forced to admit that the word means
these resemblances, they are no longer pure Nominalists3 for the
likeness between Smith and Brown is the same as that between Brown
and Smith.

This brings us to Conceptualism, which is the same error in a
less virulent but more insidious form, “Something in my idea of one
man'’‚ the Conceptualist would say, “is indeed identical with something
in my idea of another3 and therefore hmnanily is something more than
a wordg it is a thought. But there is nothing in the man Smsth, nothing
in the man Bmwn, which is really and truly identical in both. When we
speak of their common humanity‚ we are speaking of an abstraction
that cannot exist otherwise than mentally‚ not of the actual essence of
the men themselves.'’ In this doctrine, of course, 3 queen in a card-
pack, on a chess board‚ in a bee-hive‚ or issuing a proclamation7 is a
word standing for four distinct ideas3 and there is no doubt that Con-
ceptualism gets over the former difficulty.

But there are plenty of others, which neither Conceptualists nor
Nominalists can avoid. A chemist has three glass jars of hydrogen; that
is, he applies one and the same idea, “hyd1·ogen”, to the contents of
each jar. And his reason for doing so, the Conceptualist readily admits,
is the likeness which he perceives between them. But where is that
likeness? In his mind only? It must be so, according to the system3 for
if the likeness exists in the specimens of hydrogen — in jars No 1,
No 2 and No 3 — it is identical with itself everywhere, it is 3 universal

likeness, really existing in the things: which would contradict the Con-
