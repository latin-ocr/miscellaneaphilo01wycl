INTRODUCTION. LXXV

modern Physics and Chemistry. Some go so far as to assert that in Sir
William Thompson⁷s (Lord Kelvin's) theory of the vortex atom‚ we have
the old doctrine; the vortex movement is form, the ‘perfect ssuid’ is
matter3 the two together make the atom. But we may now return to
Wyclif, who uses the same terms⁷ as we shall see, to designate totally
different ideas.

Ch. 1. Form may be verbally defined as that through, or according
to which any being is intrinsically llzis or thzts; if ‘according to which’,
it is extrinsic form, or the pattern or exemplar of the thing made3 if
‘through which'7 it is intrinsic3 substantial if it makes the thing to be this
thing, accidental if it makes it to be thus. Wyclif, before dealing with
extrinsic or ideal forms, gives us a few preliminary remarks on the two
other species. Substantial form makes its substance to be what it is, and
accidental form is merely the mode of a substance, i. e. the substance
itself existing (or actingl in this or that way. Every accident requires a
subject, and it is only in a different sense — that of beauty, goodness
and perfection — that Augustine calls God the Supreme and sels-existent
Mode (pp. 163—167), All accidents are forms of a substance: 35 to their
degree of entity, disputes, mostly verbal, have arisen3 some denying‘, some
doubting whether they had any or not. This is hardly consistent with
Scripture. Of the two extreme doctrines - one of which says that every
thing must be sels-existent, and so an accident is nothing3 and the other
that God is the only substance, all creatures being accidents (the very
essence of Spinoza's doctrine] — Wyclif declares that he admits neither,
but states that the world, though it is an accident to God, is divided into
accident and substance, accidents bearing the same relation to their sub-
stances as created substances to God. As the latter cannot exist without
the First Cause‚ so the former cannot possibly exist without subjects.
He concludes the chapter by saying, in reference no doubt to former and
wearisome controversies on this point: “I am not going to argue the
matter again, unless arguments which I have not yet heard be brought
forward’' (pp. 167 —170). Notice why he admits, in seemingly perilous
agreement with the Pantheistic doctrine of Spinoza, that ‘the world is an
accident to God’. It is because the Universal Man, who comprises all
possible men —- that is, all men past, present and future —— is to him
a reality which ,depends upon God, and, so far 35 Ι can understand, is
an eternal existence in God; and so of all other created things,
