XXXVI INTRODUCTION.

by which this act also is enabled to reach it? and another again without
end? or none at all? Resides, the doctrine implies that the soul creates
and annihilates its own act when, after eliciting it, it passes to another.
For the act is an absolute entity which does not pre-exist in matter7
and is nowhere when not actually in the mind, No form but the human
soul has the absolute entity of a separable thing, since no other can
be conceived as existing unless actually determining a subject, and
separation would be tantamount to annihilation (p. 5—8). It is said that
these acts naturally depend on their subject, but that God might, by a
miracle‚ render them independent. But that would make all dependency
of effect upon cause a mere accident3 for, independently of any cause
but the First7 any effect might take placeg and this is unphilosophical
in the highest degree. Better say that when these acts are produced
they are created, and annihilated when they cease: though this would
make substances of them (p. 8). If any act is capable of sels-existence,
how can it be successive in its essence? Yet many mental acts are
admittedly such3 sensadons, for example7 imaginaffions, and many others
(pp. 9, 10).

Can it be said, to explain the difficulty, that one act suffices for
the perception of successive things? or that a fresh complex act is
elicited at every instant of perception? or that there are simultaneously
two distinct acm, one successive, and the other not? - Students of that
portion of Philosophy which lies on the border between Psychology and
Metaphysics‚ will here recognize the interesting question, How can we
apprehend succession, if there be nothing permanent in our acts? T. H.
Green, for instance — Ι quote the words of the President of the
Aristotelian Society (address‚ ὁῒῙἸ Nov. 1899) - “continually reiterates
the statement that the apprehension of succession cannot be itself
succession; that in order to be aware of B as succeding Α, we must
have both A and B before consciousness at once”. Wyclif, it is true,
brings this question forward only by way of argument against his
opponents3 but the very same difficulty stands in the way of those who
admit no subject, or a subject which is nothing but a series of succes-
sive acts.

One act, isit be a thing, cannot be successive3 and if not succes-
sive⁷ cannot represent succession. It would represent what is past or
future as present, i. e. otherwise than it is, and falsely. And if we can
