INTRODUCTION. LXXXI

Clz. 8. (pp. 225—234) Another series of objections is brought up
and answered with great dialectical skill. But the most striking part of the
chapter, at least in my eyes, is its conclusion. In the last five lines, Wyclif
openly denies his doctrine of the Possibles; or at least it seems so. As
I have pointed out in the essay at the beginning of this volume, nothing
(according to him) was possible, except what actually exists or will exist
at some time or other. It is at the bottom of his whole system, one of
its foundation-stones, so to speak; and you have but to read in Logiccz,
vol ΙΙ. p. 86, lines 16—36, p. 87, lines 29—37‚ and p. 89, lines 1-9,
to see what his opinion was upon this subject. Yet here he speaks of
possible beings which never at any moment of time exist! I confess, when
I saw these lines, I was sorely puzzled. Our philosopher⁷s doctrine was not
so venerable in my opinion that Ι should feel obliged, rather than to charge
him with inconsistency, to declare the passage spurious, as controversialists
are sometimes forced to do when much troubled by a text of the Bible; but
nevertheless I was far from inclined to suppose Wyclif had contradicted
himself. We must however choose between these two alternatives and a
third, which I prefer. He may have used the word possibiles in the sense
usually employed, either by oversight or in order to be more generally
understood3 or in other words, he may have meaut by possibiles things
which he himself considered as impossible. But even this explanation is
open to grave doubts, if we admit the lines as they stand to have been
written by Wyclif. Et posse existere, for instance, sounds very strangely
when we compare it with the lines in Logica that Ι have quoted.

Ch. 9. (pp. 235—242) It is lastly objected -—- and Wyclif very
rightly keeps these most serious charges for the end —- that the con-
sequences of his theory lead to heresy. Every creature, having intelligible
being that is real, would be coeternal with God. Nothing would come to an
end, but all things would be perpetual. And this reality would mean the
reality of actual, not of merely possible, existence: thus positing a world,
created indeed, but eternally created, in contradiction to the saith of the
Church, Wyclif’s answer is perfectly orthodox; he distinguishes-between
actual existence and mere intelligibility. That alone which is eternal of any
creature is its exemplar, which lives eternally in God. And here Wyclif
gives a lengthy exposition of the text of St. John, ch. Ι. Quod factum
est in ipso vita >erat (according to the ancient punctuation); and this ex-

position is remarkably beautiful. Stin, one cannot help thinking that the
