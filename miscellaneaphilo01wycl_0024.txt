XX AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF'S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.

he was condemned by the Church, is another thing altogether; and I
may here endeavour to point out a link or tWO. No more: for on one
hand, some of his peculiar views (those, for example, that concern
Church discipline) may not have been the direct outcome of his philo-
sophy; and on the other, so many have been condemned —- 24 as
erroneous by Convocation, in 13823 365 as heretical or at least false
by the Council of Constance -— that we must pick and choose. Ι take
therefore those that I think are the most important: Wyclif's doctrine
of necessity, and his opinion regarding the Eucharist.

In two very different senses, a thing may be called necessary. A
cube, in every imaginable case, has necessarily eight interior angles3
the square of five⁷ under any circumstances, and whatever suppositions
we may make, must be neither greater nor less than 25. But it is just
as necessary that, when I have waked my friend in the morning, he
does not sleep any longer3 or that, if you fire off a properly loaded
gun⁷ the shot will leave the barrel. However‚ in the two last cases we
have introduced a hypothesis, without which the necessity would not
exist; ifI wake my friend, be does not sleep3 isI fire. a loaded gun,
it goes off. There is no apparent necessity either for my waking the
man or firing the gun. In the first two cases, on the contrary, we find
necessity stripped of any hypothesis whatsoever. We have therefore two
different kinds: one hypothetical, the other absolute, according to the
doctrine usually accepted in the School, All truths that deal only with
facts that take place in time, belong to the former sort3 those based
upon generalities which do not imply actual existence, and also such as
refer to the existence of God, the absolutely Necessary Being, belong
to the latter.

Now Wyclif’s adversaries accused him from the first of confounding
these two distinct species of necessity. According to him, if he were
consistent, everything in the world, human actions included, must be
reduced to the class of things absolutely necessary. At the outset of
his career, our philosopher denied this accusation, and drew a sharp
line of demarcation between the two categories: he was no doubt doing
his best to keep within the limits of orthodoxy. Later, he admitted that
all things must inevitably occur in their time, arguing however that this
did not imply the truth of the accusation. At last, forced by consistency
and his enemies' unanswerable arguments, he granted simply that all
