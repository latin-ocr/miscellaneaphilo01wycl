INTRODUCTION. LIX

and generally dispelling the obscurity which has gathered for centuries
round the memory of the great reformer.

It may now be asked whether these Stockholm treatises are found
in MS. elsewhere. I will state what Ι have been able to discover.

In the Imperial Library at Vienna, MS. No. 4307 :2 contains ‘De
universalibus3 No. 4523:3‚ De universalibus, 4 (p. 115.) De ideis.
No. 5204: 1, De universalibus. In Trinity College Library, Cambridge7 are
first 30 (Vattier) “Tractatus de tempore 10 pp. large folio, and secondly
50 <Vattier) containing” De universalibus, De tempore, De ydeis. -— In
the Library of Trinity College, Dublin are 25. Tractatus de tempore,
37 pp. and 28. De ente universali et attributis divinis. At Lincoln Cathedral
are 1Ο [)6 universalibus. A. G. 20. De tempore, a part of ’De temporis
quidditate (?=De individuacione temporis et instantis>.¹ Furthermore‚ as
I have already mentioned, there is a copy of Wyclif's treatise ‘De univer-
salibus' in the University Library at Prague (VIII. F. Ι,),1

The size and whole appearance of the Stockholm MS. are such as
were usual with University pamphlets in the fourteenth century (see
above, p. XLVII). The treatises are dated, asIhave said, 1398. It was in that
very year that J. Huss first officiated as a public teacher at the University

of Prague. It is therefore by no means an unreasonable supposition that
these philosophical treatises formed J. Huss' earliest lectures‚ Nor need we
be astonished because Huss gave to his hearers Wyclif's philosophical
essays, instead of some independent work of his own. For according to
the statutes of the Philosophical Faculty at Prague, whereas a ‘magister
artium liberarum’ had a right to deliver original lectures‚ a ‘Baccalaureus’
on the other hand was only permitted to discourse from the written work
of an eminent Magister of Prague, Paris⁷ or Oxford. It is certainly true
that, even two years before his appearance as lecturer‚ Huss had been
promoted to the standing of Mag. artium liberarum. But it is scarcely
likely that he, a young man naturally endowed with greater acceptive
than creative ability, would at his first appearance as an academie teacher
have taken advantage of the privileges allowed him by the statutes of
April 20, 1367 (vide Loserth p. 73.) Beginner as he was7 he would have
found great encouragement and support in the authority of so prominent
a dialectician as the Oxford “Magister’' J. Wyelif. In the very next year,
