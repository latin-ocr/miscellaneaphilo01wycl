XXX INTRODUCTION.

whole work -—· would require language that might appear far too emphatic
and glowing, and perhaps out of keeping with so dry a subject as
the present. And though his collation has not resulted in the discovery
of any considerable mistakes, yet Ι think that the gratitude of the whole
Wyclif Society, as well as my own, are none the less due to him3 for
he has established the late Mr. Austin's trustworthiness as a copier3 and
this was a point of great importance, If we remember that Mr. Austin
copied out the whole of De Eale (no less than twelve long tractates)‚ it
is a relies to know that his copy os De Anima, a much more difficult
work, is yet quite sufficiently intelligible to be edited. To Dr. Furnivall,
who authorized the unusual course of having the whole tractate set up
in proof at once, so that the collation could be done in a few journeys
to Cambridge, my best thanks are also due, He was moreover so kind
as to make an extract from the Cambridge Catalogue of Manuscripts‚ and
to send me a description of the MS, C. C. C. 1033 both of which I subjoin.
