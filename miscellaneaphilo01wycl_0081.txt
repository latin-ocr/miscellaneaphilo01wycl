is all the more astonishing when we think 01 the amount 01 mental work

requisite for writing upon such abstruse subjectS.

Before giving a detailed analysis of Wyclif⁷s doctrine, it is well to
point out what Scholastics meant by maller and by form, so as to see
how much of novelty there was in his viewS.

In general, and in the widest sense of all, form was that which made
difference ¹ between a thing existing in one way and existing in another3
whilst matter was that which made it identical with itself, though modified.
Thus, a piece 01 wax is now spherical, now cylindrical: sphericity or
cylindricity would be the form: the underlying wax, identical notwithstanding
the change, would be the matter. So far as the changes which we observe
only bear upon shape, colour, and the other qualities perceived by sense,
the doctrine seems a mere statement 01 facts. But it was affirmed that
changes are going forward in nature which imply the production 01 a
totally new being, and the destruction 01 the former one, so that we can
no longer properly say, ‘This is the same substance’, as we can in the
case of wax. For when, 101· instance, wax is subjected to destructive
distillation, and can no longer revert to its former appearance, the change
is deeper and inore substantial, That —— whatever it may be -— which
underlies the present vapour, is not now capable of being a soft yellow
mass, And yet⁷ since wax changes into this vapour⁷ there is something
which all the time is the subject both 01 the wax and the vapour. These
are two specifically different substances, with the same identical substratum3
and as wax as a sphere or a eylinder is indifferent to either 01 these
shapes, so the mysterious substratum is indifferent to being visible (11-
invisible, a combustible solid or a highly inilainmable gas. But the wax
comes from the pollen 01 a plant, which in its turn has taken all that it
is from the surrounding elements; and here again we have a further
substantial change: from the inorganic elements to the living plant, from

the living plant to a product which is organic but not organizedg from

¹ Not tlte diffcreuce ilself. Wyclif, as we shall sce, takes ς101111ᾖ to mean this
difference, whether substantia! or accidental; anti this 01 course, as a relation between
two or more objects related, was necessarily a Universal.
