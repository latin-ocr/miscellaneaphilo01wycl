INTRODUCTION. XLIII

see3 but even if cured, his ‘having been blind' would still be true as a
contingent fact. To this Wyclif (lemurs, and will not admit any possi—
bility srom which the time-clement is eliminated. To say that I may not have
existed is to say that my non-existence is thinkal)le3 but to me it is not,
and the contrary proposition is an absolutely necessary truth (pp.65-—71‘).

The arguments on the opposite side are now refuted, after several
distinctions as to complete and incomplete necessity, the former either
absolute (created or uncreated) or relative3 and these distinctions show
that in the whole question there is a great confusion of terms. The
author understands by necessity something which is not in all cases op-
posed to contingency. Yet he affirms that truths in the past are of such
nature that their contradictories are inconceivable (pp. 71-741, The
Necessary cannot become contingent, but the Contingent becomes ne-
cessary by the fact that it has taken place: Non) it cannot 710! have
been. Whatever distance there may be between contingency and necessity,
time and the concourse of God⁷s action in the world can get over it.
And each contingent truth has in it, as an essential factor, the possi-
bility of becoming necessary, lt does not follow, because God is free to
give this necessity, that He is free to take it away3 and this is proved
by many instances. That we can admit that a thing has not happened
which has happened in reality proves only that we may be wrong, or
that we wish to see the result ofmaking such an admission; and not as
all that it may possibly be either true or not true. Any truth that exists
is eternal·⁷ it is neither annihilable7 nor capable of being created anew,
We say that a. man who does not yet exist is able to spend money
(sin the future)7 but that a dead man cannot possibly spend money (in
the past). Why? Because can indicates a potentiality which in the first
case exists, but in the second exists no longer. As to God’s power, we
cannot make it extend⁷ though infinite7 to the realization of absurditie33
what is not do-able cannot be done, even by Him. This does not re-
duce His power3 for we do not deny that He can do whatever by any
possibility can be done. The knowledge of the past enables us, not to
change that past, but to change the future by means of the present,
Can I not have done better than I did at such and such a time? No⁷ I
cannot now; but I could then. The Past is unchangeable. Our con-
trition is not properly for the Past. nor does it change the Past3 it

is for the present state produced in us by past acts3 it changes that, and
