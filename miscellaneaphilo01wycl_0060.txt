LII INTRODUCTION.

(vel scripturam)l pre-validam declino ab opinione priori non obstante fama
vel assercione virorum quos sequerer, considerans quod ex infirmitate
nature longe plus habeo ignorancie quam certitudinis — quod si ex
ignorancia vel quacunque alia causa (Hus: vel lapsu lingue) in isto
defecero revoco et retracto submittens me humiliter.

In Huss' treatise “De trinitate'' we find the same thought expressed
in almost the same words.

According to Dudik, this manuscript shows an excessive number of
abbreviations, is somewhat indistinctly and hastily written, and is conse-
quently especially difficult to decipher3 and the experience I have gained
from the study of its numerous obscurities leads me fully to endorse
Dudik's opinion.

1 will now record some observations on the subject of the writing
itself‚ as it appears in the different treatises.

In the first there are 37 or 38 lines to the page. The last page
has however only six lines, and of these two are in red: “Explicit tractatus
ete. The initial letters of the chapters are redg as are also several marginal
notes referring to the contents. Commas‚ stops and dividing marks occur
in the text, but the words are nevertheless occasionally run together.

There are besides numerous corrections and emendations in faint
writing. These alterations seem as a rule to have been made by a
contemporary, but strange, hand, a few passages only showing signs of
correction by a somewhat later writer. Lastly Ι may mention that here
and there spaces are left for omitted words.

In the second treatise also corrections and omissions are to be
found e. g. leaves 31 and 40. - On leaf 54 appears a phrase added
by a later hand to fill up an original omission: ——- “a condendis nouis
generibus creature’'.

The state of the third treatise is very much the same. For omis—
sions I may refer to leaves 60, 717 75, 76, (the same pages are mentioned
by Dudik).

In the fourth occur only two corrections and no omissions. In this
treatise, the only one in which are no Bohemian words, there is also
nothing in red ink, except the numbers of the pages and the first initial letter.

1«Vel scripturam³' is wanting in the Cod. Un. Prag. but is cited on the
authority of Hofler.
