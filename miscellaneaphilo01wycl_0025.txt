was necessary, without specifying any distinction3 though to the end he

upheld —- whether nominally or with sincere intention, it is hard to
say — the dogma of free—will, and our duty to act according to the
law of God.

It is easy to see how his theory leads to this consequence,
however slow and unwilling he was to go on so perilous a path. As
we have already noticed‚ nothing is possible — in Wyclif's sense of
the word -- except that which is, at some period of time. actually to
occur, and is therefore from all eternity foreknown by God as a future
truth. All other so-called possibilities are in reality impossible, since it
is God's everlasting will that they shall never be. In this view, since it
was eternally true that I shall at this instant be sitting here, writing this
article, and since the contrary of tlzz‘s is not tlzz'nkable, how can my sitting
here be aught but an absolute necessity? Wyclif at first tried to answer
the difficulty by taking the usual distinction. Granted that Ι am sitting,
it is impossible that I do not sit. This would clearly reduce the
necessity to the kind termed hypothetica13 but in his case it was not
applicable. Other philosophers might have said without inconsistency:
‘To be possible does not mean definite existence or occurrence, but
merely the denial of a contradiction in terms. Of such denials the endless
multitude is known to God, not as separate entities, but simply as
whatever will, may, or might be. It is not true as a fact that I am
standing, since Ι am seated3 but it is true that Ι might be standing just
as welL’ This ot course was an explanation that Wyclif could not give
without self-stultification. He accordingly at a later period modified his
answer. ἹΡ, he said, ‘God has willed anything to take place, it must
take place of necessity. But, since God's will, though eternal, is free
and untrammelled, the necessity fails to be absolute. ‘He might, had He
chosen, willed otherwise’. Here his opponents had him on the hip. ‘That
which God might have willed, but did not — is it something possible
or is it an impossibility? If it is possible, your whole system crumbles
to pieces3 if not, you arrive at the absurdity of saying that He might
have willed an impossible thing’. To this there was, there could be, no
satisfactory answer. Wyclif in his last years stood, through his conception
of possibility⁷ committed to a doctrine of necessity as hard and fast as
that to which in our days Determinists stand committed through their
conception of Law and Causation.
