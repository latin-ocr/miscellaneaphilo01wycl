beginning of another occur at the same instant exactly‚ whenever change
takes place. Supposing then in a moving body two degrees of speed,
A and Β, that succeed each other: A is a speed of 60 miles an hour
only, B a speed of more than 60 miles -— then the last instant at which
A is truly predicated of that mobile is the first at which it is not thus
truly predicated. A locomotive at the same instant goes only so fast
and yet it goes faster! Surely no contradiction could be more palpable.
Another example is probably yet more striking. Hardly any change can
be conceived greater than that which takes place at what is called the
‘instant’ of death. Now, this so-called instant is in reality two: the last
of Life, the first of Non-Life. Until and at that last moment of life, it
is true that the man, though dying, is living3 at that moment it is yet
salse to say that he is dead. But, ‘He is dead’, becomes true immediately
afterwards, The former instant is not the latter, though there is no
possible interval between thern. And as it is evident that in every change ——
though not so apparently — there is the same succession of distinct,
yet immediate, instants, and as we know that the duration of everything
real is a reality, it follows that those indivisible elements of duration
are also real.

How then, in this theory, are we to conceive movement as taking
place? As the infinitesimal instantaneous passage uf one punctal atom
from the site which it occupies to the next, its former site never
remaining empty, but being at once and of necessity filled by the next
punctal atom. What is called a slow continuous motion is continuous to
the senses only} it consists of a multitude of instantaneous but infinitely
short leaps, with intervals of more or fewer instants of rest between
them. But: no atom can move instantaneously through more than one
point, since the instant corresponds to the point. The swiftest possible
continnous movement is at the rate of one point per instant, when the
mobile rests nowhere on its way: and this, Wyclif thinks -— following
his belief in the diurnzil revolution of the universe —- is the motion of
the celestial Equator, outside of which there is no space. The slowest
continuous motion possible is that of the series of four points which touch
the line of the poles. These change places only once every six hours,
each occupying exactly the same site at the end of the twenty-four.

It is possible that some may say: “All these notions are mere
fantastic dreams, unworthy of the serious attention of anyone who thinks''.
