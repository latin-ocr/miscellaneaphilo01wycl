INTRODUCTION. LXXIX

nothing else but the atoms which fill the whole of space and eor-
respond to each point of the same, and which at one time may form
the body of a man, at another that of an ass, but never exist without
any form.

Ch. 5. But Wyelif’s antagonists are not yet beaten. Are we7 they
say⁷ to deny the value of the following syllogism: This is A,· tlzis same
thing is B; llze‘refore A is B? Wyelif asserts that a given man is llzal which
possesses humanity3 that the same given man is identical with his
humanity3 yet he denies that matter is form⁷ and that humanity is identical
with that whieh possesses it. As to his examples, those of the Trinity
and the Inearnation explain the unknown by what is more unknown yet3
and that of the humansty, common to its singulars Peter and Paul, merely
begs the question, since most philosophers deny the reality of Universals.
Resides, if matter and form are two distinet natures, how ean they inter-
penetrate eaeh other so as to make up one eompound (pp. 196-198)?

To this Wyelif replies by asserting that neither matter nor form
nor eompound is identieal one with another, although they have one
essenee. He points out various senses of the words nature and simplicio),
and then eomes to the fundamental distinction which, in his theory7
obtains between matter, form and eompound. The former is the essenee
qud receptive of form3 the latter is the same essenee quei generable in
matter. These, taken singly, are each the simple essenee; when together,
they are the eompound. This therefore is identical with neither, but with
both. It possesses the quality of being able to have a form⁷ and also
that of actually having it. We may eall the abstraet essenee a ‘nature’7
as we may call the eompound or its components by the same name, but
with different significations. And here we see where the syllogism given
abore is faulty. A given man is identieal with tlzczt which, ete. and he is
also identieal with his humanity3 but he is not identieal from the same
point of view (pp. 198—203). —- After touehing on the question whether
there may be many sorts of primal matter, Wyelif clears himself of blame
as eoneerns the instanees he has given. In Aristotle’s time everybody
admitted that a universal term was common to all its singulars, and the
denial of this in modern times has driven men to absurd assertions. As
to the I‘Ioly Trinity, Wyelif only intended to prove that anyone who
maintained the absurdity of the system would be also obliged to deny the
Catholie faith; and the example of Christ’s double nature in one Person
