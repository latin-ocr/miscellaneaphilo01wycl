INTRODUCHON. XLVII

municate with Pastor Lundstrom in order to induce him to change or at
least shorten part of his Introduction, It was in vain; my letter was
neither answered nor returned by post; or 11 it was, Ι never received
it. In short, I do not even know whether the editor is still living or not.
In these circumstances, I had no alternative but to print the whole of
his Introduction as he wrote it3 this has of course been done with
Dr. Furnixuall's approval; and as this Introduction deals mainly 11 not ex-
clusix‘ely with the Manuscript, its place is naturally here. What Ι shall
have to add by way of supplement and (I regret to say» in one most
important point, of contradiction, will come well enough under the head-

ing of authenticity7 date⁷ and contents.

Pastor Lundstrom’s Introduction.

Among the rich literary and bibliographical treasures in the pos-
session of the royal Library at Stockholm‚ an autograph manuscript by
John Huss de Hussinets‚ praerel‘ormer and martyr, takes a very impor-
tant place. This precious Bohemian relic, now nearly 500l years old⁷
was part 01 the rich booty 01 war, which the Swedes‚ under Genera]
Komgsmark, succeeded in making at the capture of Hradschin in Prague
on July 26⁸² 1648, on which occasion the art and treasure-chamber 01
the royal palace, as well as its valuable library, fell into the hands 01
the invaders.2 The manuscript very probably belonged to the so-called
Rosenberg Library7 a division of the Royal Bohemian Library, if the
evidence on this point is correctly interpreted. It came -— together
with the rest 01 the booty which was sent home from Prague3 — to
&tockholm in the course of the year 1649, probably during the month
01 May.4

This old codex is in quarto size and bound 111 simple parchment.
The lower cover has a llap which can be folded over and fastened
with a string like a modern note-book. At the back of the volume are
two iron studs in the form 01 small six-pointed stars3 and next the studs

are the binding-threads, six at each end.
