INTRODUCTION. LXVII

of the side-notes, should be read, with Wyclif's proofs in support of his
thesis, and the adversary’s denials and distinctions; with the adversary's
proofs of his own counter-thesis, and the distinctions and denials given
by Wyclif. But we may at least⁷ in this debate‚ call the reader’s attention
to the weak point on each side, and to the argument best pressed home
and least easily defended. In this duel of thoughts, if the report of the
debate be fair, each of the combatants failed to parry a certain stroke3
and (Ι think) both froin the same reason: each was wrong to some
extent.

On p. 138 we find the writer cornered by Wyclif’s arguments, and
actually making this astounding assertion: “A man cannot exist without
any animated being existing; and yet it is not necessary for a man to be an
animated being3 for we can conceive circumstances under which aman is not
an animated being. And thus his being animated is not essential‚ although
it is necessary, according to his nature, that he be an animated being!’'
When such an admission is made, he that makes it must be hard pressed
indeed, and Wyclif certainly scores here. Yet it was due to no weakness
on the part of the adversary3 the fault lay in the system. Nominalists
contendcd that every universal term only signified a class of existing
objects; if they did not exist, the Universal term was void of signification
as a fact. A man is an animated being3 but suppose only one man to exist,
and all other animals to be destroyed, what becomes of the class? It
would exist no longer, and the man would not be an animated being,
since there would be no others with which he can form a class. It is
necessary that man should be animated, and also a being, but not that
he should be an animated being! At least it is thus, and only thus, that
I can understand this answer, based upon a wrong and narrow conception
of classes as composed of existing‚ not of possible members: a conception
which most modern logicians repudiate. And with reason3 for when we
predicate animated of any being, we cannot help placing it in a possible
class7 whether there be other members or not. But, Wyclif maintaining that
the class exists anteriorly to the existence of the animated individual7 and
his antagonist conceiving a class only as a multitude of similar individuals,
the latter was obliged to deny what seems in reality undeniable.

Wyclif is, on the other hand, very hard pressed hunself in another
part of the debate. On pp. 143—145, we find him striving to answer

this objection: If the Universal is really one with its singular, it cannot
