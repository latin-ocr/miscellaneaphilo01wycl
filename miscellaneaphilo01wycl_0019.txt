AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF’S PHILOSOPHICAL sYsTEM. XV

for its reality upon the actual presence within it of something that is
not itself. It cannot be thought as non-existent; nor can it be thought
as existent, unless filled at every point of its (to us) boundless extent
by some corporeal substance. The world takes up all space, even to its
unimagfflable, yet existing limits3 and within space, there is not one of
its points unoccupied by a corresponding point of bodily substance: so
that a vacuum, whether of real substance or of real extension, is as
absolutely impossible as a vacuum of time. Time, a mode of being which
implies changeable duration‚ also depends on the existence of the world,
and is inconceivable apart from it. And as the ultimate parts of space
are real indivisible points, so the ultimate elements os time are real in-
divisible instants.

The illustrious Pole of whom Germans — as if they had not
enough great men of their own — would fain make a German, and
whose name has been given to our present system of astronomy, was
born 89 years after Wyclif's death. Our author, not being in such
matters in advance of his time, takes the assertion that the whole
universe revolves on its axis once every twenty-four hours as an
established fact: and on this fact he proceeds to build a series of strange,
though strictly logical inferences. Space, being the ‘whereabouts of the
world’, is necessarily motionless; whereas the world is everywhere in
motion, save along the line of the poles. It follows that both space and
the world have the shape of an immense sphere‚ perfectly smooth‚ with
no conceivable Beyond. For if the sphere were not a perfectly smooth
and regular surface — still more, if the world had the shape of a cube or
a prism —— the diurnal revolution would bring the surface of the world
out of space sometimes (which is impossible) and sometimes there would
be empty space out of the world (which is no less absurd). The argument
would⁷ it is true⁷ proceed just as well or a cylinder or a cone revolving
on its axis3 but the fact is, the idea of the universe as a sphere was
then so deeply rooted in every philosophical mind that the possibility of
these alternatives did not occur to Wyelif‚ He goes on to prove that
the universe can be neither larger nor smaller than it is. Is larges, and
space did not expand7 a portion of it would be beyond space; if smaller,
and space did not shrink, there would be a vacuum: and as we cannot
think away even the smallest part of space (just as we can add nothing

in thought to its vastness)‚ a simultaneous swelling or shrinkage both of
