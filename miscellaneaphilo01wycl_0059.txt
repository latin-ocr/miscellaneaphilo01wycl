The fifth and last treatise occupies no less than forty-seven leaves
i. e. from leaf 87 to leaf 134 and is divided into fifteen Chapters. ...
It is entitled:

“Tractatus de veris vniversalibus Magistri venerabilis Johannis
Wycleph.”

The two first pages contain a summary of the contents‚ beginning
thus: -— “Libellus de vniversalibus continet 15 capitula primum premittit
primo trimembrem distinccionem de vniversalibns &c”.

The treatise itself commences (leaf 88. a) “Capitulum primum, In
purgando errores de vniversalibns & circa (not cet. as Stephens has it)
vniversalia sunt 3¹³ introductoria premovenda & primo quod Sc . . . and

I ought here to observe that it is in Wyclif’s very treatise “de
universalibus'' that Hofler 5 and Loserth 6 discovered a passage which was
formerly considered to have a particularly important bearing upon our
knowledge of the personality of Huss. The words referred to are: . . “Ego
autem statui michi ipsi pro regula, quod quociescumque videro racionem

1 Dudik here (Vide Forsch. in S„ leaf 202) wrongly gives ‘explicast The word
is certainly so written in the text that one one might be tempted to follow Dudik⁷s
reading, or rather read ‘expliat³. But this may be a misprint, as on leaf 198 he has
it correctly. The word has in our MS. something like this appearance ‘expliat³‚ but

a = ci, not a. 2 Not Jeronymi, as Dudik has on leaf 202, though he writes it
correctly on leaf 198. 3 Not Slavi as Dudik. 4 Not Hussynec as Dudik,
reads. 5 Hoflerz Anna v. Luxemburg in den Denkschriften der Wiener Akademie
