ΑΝ ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF'S PHILOSOPHICAL sYsTEM. XXIII

Now the Real presence, in Wyclif’s system, made no difficulty
whatever. Christ’s Words, ‘This is my body'‚ spoken by the everlasting
Truth, made that Presence true for all consecrated hosts, thenceforth to
the end of time. Nothing is true but what really exists at some Noun
Christ’s Presence was therefore real, and coincides with the consecration
of each Host. ssut, according to the system that we have expounded‚ a
material body cannot exist without occupying certain fixed points of
space⁷ and thus being extended. It is only as a Universal Reality that
anything can be one in many; and it is only as figured by the bread
that Christ's Body can be present entire in every part. ‘This, this,
this .. . . particle of bread is really the figure of Christ’s Body’, exactly
corresponds to: ‘A‚ Β, C .. .. is a man.’ Thus the bread passes from
being a purely material substance to being a singular of the Universal
‘Figure of Christ'‚ which has real entity; and it is in this sense that
Wyclif admits both the Real Presence and Transubstantiation.

But, does the bread cease to exist? That were a sheer impossi-
bility. We have already seen that space, created together with the
world, is necessary at every point of its extent. Should a single atom,
at the instant when another moves out of its site into the next, fail to
replace the vacated site, the site -— as it must be the sile of something Μ
would exist no longer; which is absurd. How much more absurd is
then the hypothesis that the¹ multitudinous atoms which make up the
smallest morsel of bread7 can be annihilated! This is the true reason
why Wyclif so strenuously denies that accidents can be separated from
their substances: if they did, they would be sustained either by an
impossible vacuum, or by another substance having accidents of its own.

Thus the bread remains; but we may no longer look upon it as
bread, since Christ has told us what it is now. To the eye of saith,
its material being is as nothing compared with the supernatural entity
which has been added thereto, and which is in all truth worthy of our
adoration. A bit of glass‚ plunged in the sun’s rays, appears to our eye
as a bit of light, not of glass: and such should be the attitude of our
mind towards the Holy Eucharist.

Such a doctrine, notwithstanding Wyclif's masterly defence in
Convocafion, could not fail to be condemned as an error, unless his
ecclesiastical judges had been Realists‚ and morem-er, Realists in his
sense of the word. VVhether they fully understood him or not, may be
