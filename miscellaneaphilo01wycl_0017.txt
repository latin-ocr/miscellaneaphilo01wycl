ΑΝ ΕΞΞΑΥ ΟΝ WYCLIF'S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM. XIII

the one is certainly not his being the other. You take a cup of tea,
and experience 3 taste at once bitter and sweet3 it is one sensation,
and yet you distinguish the bitterness from the sweetness. Bxiessy, in
nature we are continually meeting with instances of two things that are
identical with a third, and yet differ from one another. Even the mathe-
matica] concept of the whole and its parts would be impossible, if we
denied this. The whole is identical with all its parts, and to some extent,
with every one of them: each part is distinct from every other, and no
part is anything that the whole is not.

Thus, though humanity is every individual man, one individual is
not the other. Animation is common to brutes and meng nevertheless,
no brute is a man. No confusion results from the admission that the
same universal Life vivifies both animals and plants. That which is God
is a creature, since Being is the same in both; yet no creature, as a
creature, is God.

Let us now, after this first glimpse at Wyclif’s system⁷ go back
five hundred years and look into our young philosopher’s mind, as after
some sharp struggle with his life-long antagonists7 the Franciscan
Nominalists‚ he walks out into the country round Oxford to soothe his
tired brain with quiet musings. The mystery of the Holy Trinity, of
which his doctrine multiplies vestiges throughout creation, is everywhere
and always present to him. ‘Neither contounding’ the individuals‚ ‘nor
dividing’ their essenees, his glauce at once takes in the outward diversity
of thingS, and the unity which underlies it. The sky is azure, the Isis
which reflects it is azure, the forget-me-nots upon its banks are azure3
and yet they are not three amires, but one azure. The plough-buy whom
he sees afar has bodily existence, the oxen moving under the goad
have the same corporeity, the glittering ploughshare is corporeal too:
each is other7 but their corporeity is One. The light which falls on the
landscape is an entity‚ the landscape lit thereby is also an entity3 so is
the movement of the rolling water, and so likewise is the water that
rolls: vast as the distance between them is, both phenomena and
substances share one Universal in common. And this Entity is the same
with that of the Most High. The truth of their present mobile existence
was as real in God before the world began7 as it is now; the fact that
αἱ this point of time tlzey exist, never was, never will be false3 He
gave it being by willing that some day ——- this day! -— they should be,
