AN ESSAV ΟΝ WYCLIF’S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM. VH

his life? To answer this, we must first state the problem, so famous of
old (though it now sounds like a puzzle in Grammssar or Dialectics) which
Nominalists‚ Conceptualists, and the various schools of Realists set them-
selves to solve.

There is no doubt that the same names are not always used in
the same sense. Mr. Rochester was a bear3 there are many bears in
the Zoological Gardens3 others in the Stock Exchange3 there is a Great
and a Little Bear in the sky. We may call a nine-thonged wlfip, or a
mouse-eating animal⁷ or a spiteful woman by the name os Cat. Either a
playing-card or the ruler of a nation may be a Queen. These terms
are equivocal. But there are cases when the same word, applied to
different objects‚ means tlze same. Smith is a man3 Brown is a man
likewise. But the word ‘man’ meaning the same in both cases, here
comes the question: The same what? To this we have three principal
replieS. Nominalists say, ‘The same word'g Conceptualists‚ ‘The same
concept, or idea’3 Realists, ‘The same thiug’.

In the theory of extreme Nominalists (of whom the famous Ockam
was the acknowledged exponent) no general term has any meaning
whatever, unless applied to its singularS, and so long as it is thus
applied. It is by itself a mere empty sound, — a flatus vocis, as he
chooses to call it. We find that two or more singulars resemble each
other, and we take a general term to classify them according to that
resemblance. Thus used, it has meaning3 not otherwise. There is nothing
in the world save singulars: when taken apart from its singulam, a
general term therefore signifies nothing. Smith is a man3 in so far as
‘man’ signifies Smith (consequently a concrete being, quite diverse from
‘man' taken to mean Brown) it has signification, In so far as it is taken
for something that is the same in both Smith and Brown, it has none.
We docket singulars with general terms‚ just as a shop-keeper will
docket various articles with a card, bearing: ‘Price 3s4d. Take the ticket
off the article, and ‘Price 3s4<1 has no longer any distinct meaning.

Such is the theory. It has nothing save its boldness to recommend
it, and is palpably absurd. If it were true, what would become of the
sels-evident distinction, glanced at in the last paragraph hutone, between
equivocal and univocal terms? It would exist no more. There is a
resemblance, far-setched indeed and fictitious‚ between the Zoological
Garden bears, those in human society7 and those in the skyg between
