LXIV INTRODUCTION.

the contrary to the latter conclusion: to me the supposition of Wyclif's
authorship is absolutely incredible. The writer discusses at length external
evidences of various kindsg but it is strange that neither Dudik nor himself
should have taken the trouble to examine the internal evidence afforded
by the work itself; that so much should have been made of ‘Magister
meus Reverendus' — who, notwithstanding LundstrOm's doubts and
suppositions‚ certainly was Wyclif — and so little of the thesis which
the said ‘Reverend Master’ was evidently upholding. Nor can it be said
that the treatise is incomprehensible on account of its Scholastic termino-
logy. When we find the writer all along maintaining that there are no
real Universals, while the ‘Reverend Master' asserts them throughout
the work — it requires but little acquaintance with Mediaeval philosophy
to conclude that Wyclif was not its author3 unless indeed this was written
at the very outset of his University studies. And even this possibility
disappears for any one who has studied his system7 which is essentially
the same as that set forth in the arguments of the “Reverendus Magister.”
This, it is true, Lundstrom could not have done3 but might he not have
thought it incredible that Huss should have taken the trouble to copy a
work of Wyelif‚ written before Wyclif was himself? I should have much
preferred not to have been obliged to say this, for the editor⁷s Introduction
plainly shows much serious and pains-talzing research; nnhappily there
is, I believe, a tendency among certain scholars to overlook internal
evidence and to overrate that which is externati, especially in works of
this kind. Here we have a case in which all disputes and conjectures
might have been easily settled by the most superficial examination of the
text itself.

On p. 131, we see clearly that according to the ‘Magister’ with whom
the writer is at variance all through, ‘idem est veritas rei et entitas
universaliter’‚ This might perhaps fail to be understood as an assertion
of Realism. But what of the Master⁷s conclusion (p. 133) Universale est,
to which the writer opposes (p. 134) Nullum universale reale in essendo
est, with clear arguments (pp. 134—138) to prove his point.. .. ‘Quod
non est universale in essendo reale . .. probatur . . . Vel universale in
essendo reale et suum singulare differunt, vel non . . . Si esset universale
in essendo reale . . , Dicit [Magister] quod universale est, et mea conclusio
ponit oppositum... And again (p. 144) Volui probare quod nullum
universale in essendo est'. And on p. 148: ‘Posuit magister istam con-
