X ΛΝ ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF'S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.

We might easily show how such doctrines work in the fields of
Law and Ethics. Obligation‚ punishment, goodness, virtue, and so forth,
become at most the merest fabric of our brains. The Artful Dodger is
not sent to prison for having picked a pocket. No, indeed: in so far as
this is an abstract statement, in so far it is salse. He cannot be sent to
an abstraction for having picked — an abstraction! He is sent, say, to
the Old Bailey for picking the right coat—tail pocket of ΜΓ. So-and—so‚
on such a date. Still less can we say that picking pockets is an offence
punishable by imprisonment, unless we mean this to refer to and symbolize
a number of cases like the preceding case: otherwise it is a mere ideal
proposition, good for nothing. Now, as a summary, merely symbolizing
cases that have occurred in the past, it has no value whatever as
concerns the present or the future: and the whole binding power os
Law is thus swept away! The same is true as regards morality. [ought
fo do llzis remains indeed, if we mean thereby an individual feeling of
obligation on some special occasion3 but try to lay down rules of
conduct — even to Nelson’s famous signal: ‘England expects every man
to do his duty' -- and they vanish into thin air. If duty could be done,
an abstraction would be really existing in the act by which it is done.
And yet English sailors did their duty at Trafalgar ——- let Conceptualists
explain the fact how they may.

If I have exposed these absurdities at such length, it is because
the reader must see all Wyclif’s reasons for choosing the contrary
alternative. Perhaps Ι shall therefore be excused if, at the close of this
long investigation, I look for a moment at the humorous side of these
theories. You are very sharpset‚ and enter a restaurant in a hurry. A
waiter of the Nominalist persuasion (Heaven save the markl) comes at
your call. “1 want a grilled steak‚ you say''. “Beg pardon, sir, you
don't3 there is no such thing in the world. What you want is the
particular grilled steak of which you are thinking’'. — “1 am thinking
of none in particular‚’' you protest3 “any steak will do for me'’. “Excuse
me, sir‚'’ he replies; “any steak will not d03 any sleak is only a word'’.
You leave the place, blessing the man, and go to another restaurant,
where another waiter (a Conceptualist this time) politely assures you
that what you want, not being something concrete and determined, is
merely your general idea of a steak‚ which he regrets that he cannot
supply, there being only singular steaks in the house. “Then give mea
