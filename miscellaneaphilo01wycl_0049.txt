INTRODUCTION. XLI

Here Wyclif answers that, without being a movement‚ it may be the
cause of one3 and in a more universal sense, it may be called a move-
ment7 as a tendency towards something or other (pp. 47-49). “How‘’‚
it is urged, “could a man elicit the same act or commit the same sin
twice, if that were not a quality, now present in the individual‚ now
absent therefrom?'’ Here Wyclif simply denies that a man can commit
the same sin twice3 its being committed at a different time makes it
another sin (pp, 49—52). Lastly‚ it is objected that what is in, yet
different from the soul, what determines a change therein by its advent,
and may come and go without the destruction of the same, must be a
quality. These arguments, Wyclif shows, prove only that there is a
happening by which the soul is modified; but not that the modification
is something in itself (pp. 52—58),

The question discussed in the first chapter of the Second Part is
somewhat out of the lines of modern thought, and requires a short
explanation. Not as to its connection with the former problems3 every
student of Wyclif knows that he allows himself a very wide range.
Thus7 when writing about mental acm, he conceived himself perfectly
justified in positing theses as to their truth or falsehood. The explanation
concerns the essential meaning of the discussion. A proposition is cou—
tingently true, if, while we admit its correspondence to facts, we are
able to conceive at the same time that it might not correspond to them.
It is necessarily true, if such non-correspondence is inconceivable. The
question concerning propositions as to past facts thus becomes an in-
quiry whether or not such propositions7 if true, can be conceived as
true contingently3 if false, as contingently false. If, for instance, it be
true as a fact that Queen Victoria reigned over England‚ can We
conceive her as possibly not having reigned? In the preceding essay on
Wyclif's philosophy, Ι have shown that Wyclif understands by the Possible
everything that has taken place, is now, or will take place at some su-
ture time3 that and that only. All the rest is impossible„ inconceivable,
absurd. ssy that means he closes the door on many a Scholastic dis-
cussion3 and to ask what would have taken place if Adam had refused
to eat the apple is to him the same as to ask about the mathematical
consequences of the proposition 2—1—2z4 being false7 or of a triangle
having four sides. And so far as Adam is concerned, most people would
hardly trouble to contradict him. But as his view extends to all things
