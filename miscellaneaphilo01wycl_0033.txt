INTRODUCTION.

 

As Wyclif's philosophical works, though extremely voluminous, con—
sist for the most part of treatises which he himself intended for his
great work, the Summa De Ente, it was thought right by the Committee
of the Wyclif Society (with whom I entirely agree) that Logica should

impossible for me to do this, ΜΓ, Matthew most kindly journeyed to
Cambridge several times, and at a very great cost of time and pains,
went through all the proofs‚ To express my full acknowledgment of this
labour of his —- and also of his scholarly help, bestowed throughout the
