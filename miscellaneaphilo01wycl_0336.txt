‘In what manner does this thing exist?³
ib.; they add an entity, but only a
modal one, to their subject, 165, 1663
God is called by augustine, the 53-
preme Mode, but not in this sense,
‘mode³ here meaning goodness and
order, 1663 the sense of ‘mode’ as an
accident means one of the nine cate-
gories exclusive of substance, 1673 the
disputes as to the entity conferred by
a mode is one of mere words, 168;
entity, when predicated of accident and
of substance, has two like but not
identical meanings, ib.,· some say that
an accident is nothing, and that all
beings are substances, some that God
alone is a substance and 311 011161
beings are accidents3 both views are
exaggerated, but the latter is nearest
the truth, 167, 1683 substantial form
is that by which any substance is that
substance, 1763 two kinds, one requi-
ring no subject to sustain their entity,
as angels, 177, who are not made up
of matter and form, 1783 the 011161, of
forms upheld by a body, 179, 316 merely
the whole essence, taken abstractly,
ih,· it is foolish to think of matter and
form as two separate but combined
parts, of which the substance con-
sists, 179, 180; or that the latter is
capable of increase and diminution, for
that would then be accidental, not sub-
stantial, which is added or taken away
from the form, 180; but we may un-
derstand substantial form in a wider
sense, as that which is always found
with the substance, 182. Obiection
that this view destroys specific diffe-
rences, by positing that the same one
essence may become anything in the
world, 182, 1833 answered by the fact
that essence bears no reference to
genera 01 species3 one thing cannot be
another at the same time, 183—185;

of a form is not movement (or change),
1933 every form is, in a sense, acci-
dental to matter, ib ,· but when its sub-
ject is absolutely potential, it gives it
actual substantiality‚ 1943 the recepti-
vity of matter, utterly passive, cannot
be called a form or a determination,
194, 195. Objections: that in t'nis view
matter and form are identical, or the
expositorial syllogism is worthless, 1963
that the examples given explain the
unknown by the unknown, 197, and
11131, if matter and form be not
identical, they are two different beings
occupying the same space, ib.,· ans-
wered by the statement that these are
not identical, though they go to form
one and the same essence, 1983 matter
is the essence qud receptive of form,
form is the essence quei generable in
matter, 200, the simple essence,
receiving form, becomes composite,
201, 2023 these distinctions given, no
expositorial syllogism concludes any-
thing against Wyclif. 203; he does not
prove the unknown by the unknown,
but points out that any attack upon
his doctrine menaces Christianity, 204,
2053 the difference between matter and
form is merely logical, 205, 206.
