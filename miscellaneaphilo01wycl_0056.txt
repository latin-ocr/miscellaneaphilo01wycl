XLVIII INTRODUCTION.

The writing is inscribed upon good firm paper 01 3 somewhat
yellowish tinge. The pagination has been done with red ink, and is
evidently os the same date as the manuscript itself. The margins are not
particularly wide, measuring as a rule about half an inch.1 The
volume contains five treatises, principally of a philosophical and scho-
lastic nature.2 The title, which is to be found at the end, is as

follows: — lsz'quft tractatus metlzapysici per manus Mag solz. Hus de
cm. 13983

It is very remarkable that an old note on the upper cover appa-
rently assigns the authorship of three of the five treatises to Huss. On
this cover we find first in more modern characters No. 9 (referring to
the 1734 catalogue)3 and then immediately below, the following words
are to be distinguished on the authority of Dudik <Forsehungen in
Schweden), “Magistri Johannis Hus onus tractatus de ydeis secundus re-
plicacio universalis tercius eius de veris universalibus.’' That this old an-
notation (see pp. LIII, LIV) is not accurate seems probable, for several
reasons which I will subsequently adduce.

1 l may here record some other minor points of interest which 1 observed during
my study of the MS. Ι found that the volume, as far as leaf 20, had been perforated
by some sharp three-edged instrument, which, as far as 1 can judge. may well have
been 3 swordpoint. The upper cover is pierced as well, but in the first leaves, which
are evidently a later insertion and one of which is glued to the cover, this little
triangular hole is of course wanting. Can it have been some Swedish soldier who,
intoxicated with victory at the capture of Hradschin, thus wished to set with the
point of his sword a conqueror's mark which should commemorate for ever the
acquisition of this precious document by his countrymen? There are also one or
two other small peculiarities to be noticed. On leaf 108 a coarse, but characteristic
face has been drawn with black ink in a large red initial. Again, at two or three
places a rather large hand pointing has been drawn, e. g. leaf ‘232¹’y bya large red
initial, and leaf 78. 2 I say “principally⁷‘‚ for purely theological subjects are
also treated of. For instance, at the end of the first treatiSe‚ sin against the Holy
Ghost is discussed, and among other things the writer points out the absurdity of
maintaining before a man's death, and without a special manifestation, that he has
been guilty of sin against the Holy Ghost, and on the strength of this assumption
depriving him of the resource and consolation of prayer. 3 Dr·- B· Dudik
wrongly states in his “Forschungen in Schweden fiir Mahrens Geschichte⁷³, p. 183

that the MS. dates from the year 1389. Possibly this is a misprint, but it occurs
both in the index and text,
