XXXII INTRODUCTION.

(2). Authenticity of the Treatise.

In Shirley's catalogue the only reasons given to prove that the work
is Wycliffs are (1) the author's name in the MS. and (2) the title given
by Bale, but with another incipit. The second is plainly inadequate, and
so is the first, as we shall see when we come to examine the authorship
oslt’cplictzlio cle Universalibns. But there is far stronger internal evidence
in favour of its authenticity. Setting apart the fact that Scripture is much
less quoted here than in most of the other philosophical treatises &which
may easily be explained by supposing it written at an early date) the
style is Wyclif’s‚ and the ideas are his as well; less marked perhaps,
but plain to anybody who has made a study of his style and system.
The writer shows, besides, the same intimate acquaintance with Gilbert de
la Poree (pp, 2, 39), Alliacen (p. 12). Vitellio (p. 13, 46), Bradwardine
(p. 37) and others, as Wyclif does in Logiccc and elsewhere. What is
more, he speaks of himself as intending to expound his doctrine concerning
[ruth and falsehood in a certain first book De Insolubilibus’. Now this
is precisely the title given by Shirley to one os the lost works onyclif
whose first words have not been preserved3 though (p. 28, note) I venture
to suppose that it is one os the tractates in Logiccz. It is difficult, in
presence of all these indications7 to imagine that a contemporary to Wyclif
existed, equal to him in talem, similar as to mental acquirements and
erudition, identical in doctrines, and yet so completely unknown that his
very name has not survived‚ and his De Insolubilz'bus has been ascribed

to the other. Yet that we must assume, if we deny the authenticity of
De Actibus Anime.

(3). Date of the Work.

Assuming the authenticity of De Actibus, we are at once able, not
indeed to give any precise date to this work, but to place it before
Logica to which I have (Int. to vol. I, p. VH) tried to ascribe the
date of 1361 circiter. He combats most strongly the doctrine of absolute
accidents (cap. IV), and yet he nowhere openly denies or seems to
doubt the possibility of annihilation, as he does in Logica. Besides, as I
point out in a note (p, 28), it is very likely that the Da: Insolubllibus
he proposes to publish is a tractate of Logiccz itself. In Logica, besides,

he goes very completely into the theory of vision, as it was then
