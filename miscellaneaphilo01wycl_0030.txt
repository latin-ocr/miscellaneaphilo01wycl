XXVI AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF‘S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.

destroyed) that at the bottom of all our enquiries into first principles
we find sels—contradiction on every side, and that accordingly, though
we cannot really tell what Tiine and Space are, we should confine our
investigations to what is in Time and Space: — this well-known, this
world-renowned theory, is based on an implicit denial that things are as
we know them. All knowledge dissolves into sels-contradicti0n3 things
alone do not contradict themselves,

Is there then no answer to the question, save plain Yes or No?
no middle way between the absolute affirmative of the one class, and
the uncompromising negative of the other? There is; but in that very
answer we see the reason why it fails to satisfy.

Do things exist as they are known to us? AS is a very short
word, but it has two meanings nevertheless. Let us look closer. Are
things seen in a looking-glass as they are in reality? Yes and no. There
is a certain resemblance, more or less perfect, if that be meant, but
the difference is always that between the image and the original. In like
manner, — so far as any comparison can be drawn, -- the human intellect
is the mirror of Nature. Our thoughts are indeed in a way the images
of things, but we can no more conclude that things have the same
nature as our thoughts than we can infer that a nosegay out of a
looking-glass is of quicksilver amalgam, because its image within the
looking—glass is not a thing distinct from the silvering. Thus, things do
really exist as they are known to us: that is, they giving rise to our
thoughts and ideas, we have the right to reason from the latter to the
former. There must be some resemblance, however vague, between
representation and that which is represented. If it were totally unlike in
representation, it would not be represented at all. — But, if AS is made
to mean a complete identity of nature between what we know and our
knowledge, then it may be boldly denied that things are as we know
them. What we know of a grain of sand is not z'dentical with what it
is in itself3 for what we know os it extends only to a few points of
view, and there will ever remain infinite possibilities of more knowledge.
All the sophisms in the world will never overthrow this simple yet clear
distinction.

Now it is precisely because this answer, given by many great
philosophers, is so very cautious and moderate, that we feel disappointed.
It is the old tale of Scylla and Charybdis over again, the breakers that
