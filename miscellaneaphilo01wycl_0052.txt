XLIV INTRODUCTION.

that alone. A man who has sinned is not to blame because he is now
able not to have sinned‚ but because, when he did, he had the power
not to sin. At the beginning of the world the possibility of my being
born then existed; as time went on, it became less; at the instant of
rny birth it was narrowed to that instant and no other (pp, 74—87)⁸

Chapters 2 and 3 (pp. 87—116) are perhaps the hardest to un-
derstand in the whole treatise3 and it will suffice to give a short synopsis
os Wyclis's theory and of those which he assailed. As a consequence of
their denial of the necessity of propositions concerning the past⁷ which
has already been summarized, Nominalists were forced to take up the
position that possibility or impossibility depended upon the axiom: no-
thing can be and not be at tlte same time. Whatever did not contradict
this (and things past, no longer existing7 could not contradict it) was
contingently true or false, but always possible3 what contradicted it was
impossible independently of any other truth. This therefore was the only
criterion of the extent of God's power. Wyclif attacks this doctrine with
great 116116111611667 attempting to show that, if things contingent in the
present are contingent in the past, the proposition that Nothing in the
world exists is admissible in that theory3 whence he draws the most
damaging and absurd inferences against his adversaries. A possibility
independent of God is according to him the source of numberless errors
which he points out in detail. He is convinced that the proposition, or
rather the fact (though he seems not to distinguish between the two}
that God exists, is the primordial truth on which the axiom of contra-
diction depends. It is because God exists that Nothing can at the same
time be and not be3 and not vice versa. All possibility and impossibility
therefore proceed from God’s power. We cannot say that God’s power
does not extend to this because it is impossibleg but, This is impos-
sible, on account of God⁷s power not extending to it. And, though such
an assertion looks extravaganty if we remember what he means by pos-
sible (that which at any time exists or will exist) it is in keeping with the
rest of his doctrine. At the same time, whilst he was free not to admit
a wider definition, his Nominalist adversaries had quite as much right to
define the possible as llzat‘ of which llte exislence7 no matter at what
time, does not involve contradiction.

In the last chapter, there is a return to the preceding question of

‘quality'. But whereas Wyclif argued before that no mental act was a
