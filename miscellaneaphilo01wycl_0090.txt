LXXXII INTRODUCTION.

difficulty might be urged farther. For, unless our authvr is inconsistent
here, ‘mere intelligibility' of which he speaks is but an unintelligibility.
And if the Universal Man is independent os each and all of his singulares
ancl is something really existing‚ is he not real from all eternity? Here.
Ithink‚ Wyclif could but admit the conclusion, saying however (as 1
previously supposed) that in so far as this universal exists anteriorly tc
its singulars, it is the Ideal Man, not essentially other than God; and
that the same, as existing in its singulars, is distinct from God. This
would explain his remarkable statement on p. 239, that “he cannot go so
for as to assert the identity of all things with God, since he would risk
being misunderstood”3 and when he denies (on the same page) that any
creature exists eternally‚ he evidently means ‘in so far as it is a creature.
singular, and restricted to being at some moment of time’. In so far as
it is identical with its Unioersal, which abstracts from all time, and has
been from all eternity willed by God, it exists otherwise: and in so far
it is not a creature. Our author, as we see, is able by this distinction
to affirm in one sense that no creature is God, and in another to say —
though he tells us he does not think himself justified in affirming this —
that every being is God, “concedendo asinum et quodlibet nominabile
esse Deum”.

Such is the treatise De materia el Forma, in which we plainly see
the principles laid down in Logica now worked out to very startling
conclusions. It was already easy to perceiye in the former work how
nearly VVyclif's system approached to the Pantheism of the old Realists:
here the resemblance becomes much more striking. He never, it is true,
declared himself a Pantheist openly; and his boldness was such that, had
he believed his system led to it, the declaration would no doubt* haye
been made. But his subtility was as great as his boldness7 and he probably
found in his distinction grounds for holding back, which, inadequate though
they might haye seemed to other minds, were amply sufficient to his own,
Others may haye. thought him a Pantheist·⁷ he certainly held, from first to

last, that he was not.
