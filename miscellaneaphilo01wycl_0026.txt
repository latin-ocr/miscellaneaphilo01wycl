XXII AN Essfo ΟΝ WYCLIF’s PHILOSOPHICAL sYsTEM.

His way of admitting Free-Will is also very similar to the sense
in which Determinists admit Choice. It is an established fact⁷ they say,
that human beings are able to choose between two or more alternatives.
That cannot by any means be denied. But as there must be a reason
why, or a cause, for everything that goes on in the world, our choice‚
which we think is determined by and depends on ourselves, is in reality
determined by and depends on causes other than ourselves. Without
them, it could never be made3 with them, it must —— andin the direction
towards which those causes point. Substitute the will of God —- the
ultimate Reason Why of everything in Wyclif’s theory -— for Cause3
substitute Free-Will for Choice3 and you have his position, which is
very like theirS. “We have Free-Will, and it is God's eternal deter-
mination that at such and such a time we shall choose freely between
two alternatives7 though one of them is impossible, since He has willed
that it shall never be chosen”. How anyone can reconcile Choice with
Determinisin7 or Necessity with Free—Will‚ would puzzle me to say, nor
does it require to be said. Let it suffice to have pointed out that our
author is here in no worse plight than a certain ssourishing school of
modern thinkers.

In Wyclif's doctrine of the Eucharist, there are likewise several
stages, brought about by the same process. Before the publication of
liis philosophical works, his belief, even in the latest stage, seemed to
be hopelessly inconsistent, nay, self-contradictory3 and readers will think
it no easy task to clear him of this charge. Whilst maintaining that the
substance of bread remains after consecration‚ he admits Christ’s Real
presence, which he, in the same breath almost, affirms to be ‘figurative
or sacramental’3 and he applies the name of Transubstantiation to the
change which occurs, A figurative presence which is real! a transub-
stantiation that takes place, though the substance is not changed! What
can this mean? Did so keen a logician really contradict himself, or did
he belie his own principles on account of bodily fear?. ‘How shall we
sind the concord of this discord?’

The generally received doctrine was that at the words of con-
secration the substance of bread at once ceased to exist, the sensible
appearance alone remaining3 whilst wherever the bread had been, and
its appearance continued to be, Christ’s Body was present, not emended,
but entire in each smallest portion of what formerly was bread.
