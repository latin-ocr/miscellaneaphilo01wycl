INDEX.

Miracle, by a, an accident, might be se-
parated from its subject, 121, but this
would involve very great difficulties, 123.

Miracles, possibility of, 74.

Modes (or measure, mensura) of exist-
ence, seven different, 210, 211.

Movement, in what sense it is under-
stood by the School3 its specieS‚ 34
and note.

Music of the spheres, the, 49.

Musings, the, of Wyclif at Oxford in his
youth, XIII, XIV.

Nature, seven significations of the word,
198, 199.

Nature’s moral law is such that even
God cannot dispense with it, 23.

Necessary and contingent truth are con-
fused in the theory of Wyclif's adver-
saries, 427.

Necessity of a thing known to be eter-
nally true as taking place in time, 673
different senses of the word, 71, 723

Negation‚ every, is based upon an affir-

note.

multitude of persons, were a great

Ockam’s razor, 119 note.

Omnipotence, God’s, is limited by Him-
self alone, 109, many subtleties have
been uttered in this matter, such as
v. g. that God can do anything that
we do not distinctly see to be absurd,
make the same thing exist at once in
different places with contrary attributes,
or contrary attributes co-exist in the
same thing, 110.

Opponents of Realism, the, admit the ‘Uni-
versal Man' merely as an idea or as part

Order of publication, the, of Wyclif’s
philosophical works, XXIX.
Organic and non-organic acts, 40.

Pantheum, a snare for many Realists,
XII; never admitted by Wyclif, though
he seems very near 10 it, LXXVI,
LXXXI, LXXXII.

Pantheistic consequences urged against
Wyclif’s doctrine3 the actual and eter-
nal and real existence of all creatures
in God's mind, 2353 Wyclif denies this,
saying that no creature, as such, is
eternal; its intelligible, not its caused
being, lives in God eternally, 2363 to
say that every creature is in God does
not imply that it is eternal, since its
archetype alone is eternal, 2373 this
would be wrongly expressed if we said
that all is identical with God, 239;
intelligible Being is ‘life’ in Him, but
this life does not imply temporal
existence, 239, 2403 and although it
exists eternally, we deny its existence
at any moment of time, because God
does not know it as existing thus, 240,
241. A man is God, qud thought of
eternally by God3 but then he is not
a man, having no self of his own, 241,
2423 All creatures are as accidents to
God, in whom they inhere more
closely than any so-called accidents in
their substances, 242.
