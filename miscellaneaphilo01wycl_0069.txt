INTRODUCTION. LXI

because the great expenditure of time consequent upon the difficulty of
deciphering the MS„ with its obscurities and numerous abbreviations, has
frightened would-be investigators from attempting the [ask.

The interest which I feel for the work has led me to make a
genuine attempt to deciphes that one of the five treatises of the MS. which
has secmed to me most likely to repay me sos my pains. I was influenced
in my Choice, partly because this particular treatise is a reputed original
work by Huss, which gives it a special interest, and partly because of its
shortness‚ and furthermore by the fact that the “replicacio de univer-
salibus'’ is the only one of the five contained in the Stockholm MS. which
seems to be unique. As far as I can learn, no other library in Europe
possesses a copy of this treatise.

May I conclude by hoping that my work will be looked upon as a
small and humble contribution towards the realisation of the great and

noble task which the Wyclif Society has undertaken?

Upsala, October 1880.
