distinct from the mindg the second (pp. 347-38) is a summary 01 the
arguments in favour of the position that such acts 1116 qualities (which,
it would appear, some philosophers understood 115 being separable
entities); and the third (pp. 38—58> is consecrated to the refutation 01
these arguments, The second part (pp. 59—128) is in four chapters,
the first of which (pp. 59--87) (leals with the question whether the
mental act of affirmation, if relating to the past, must be either necessarily
true or necessarily false. Tne second attacks the position that no
mental act save an affirmation which implies sels-contradiction 61111 imply
absolute impossibility (pp. 87--105). ‘l‘he third (pp, 105- 116) establislies
W'yclif’s theory: that God's existence is the necessary truth 011 which
both possibility and impossibility depend¹ And the fourth (pp. 116—128'*
reverting to the theory 01 mental acts considered 115 qualities, argues
that even 11 they were, no quality 61111 be an absolute accident, scparable
