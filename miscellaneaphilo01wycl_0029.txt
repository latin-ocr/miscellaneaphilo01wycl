AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF’S PHILOSOPHlCAL SYSTEM. XXV

utterance to any criticisms on the subject. Yet I do not see that any
criticisms of mine are worth having. Wyclif's system, and not what Ι
think of it, may possibly interest the public. It is here set forth3 let
those who care, judge for themselves. I have not taken the part of a
judge, but of an advocate3 and os an advocate only in the hope to
render comprehensible the fierce enthusiasm — fierce at times even to
the shedding of blood — that so novel and yet so plausible a view os
the universe excited in his days, And, to speak quite frankly, I have
yet another reason.

It is true that both Nominalism and Realism have long been dead,
so far as concerns the formal matter of their disputes. The issues raised
by them, however7 are not dead⁷ and remain to divide — perhaps for
ever — most if not all philosophers into two classes; and it is with
the class to which Wyclif belongs that I am in greater sympathy.

Are things as we know them to be? That which is in our minds -—
does it exist in itself as it is in our minds? Answer yes, and you have
not only Wyclif's Realism, but Berkeley's denial of matter, German
Transcendentalism, and the various shades of thought of modern Ι-
dealists: all belong to the same class. ‘To be, is to be perceived;
matter exists as and when we know it3 outside of the knower, it is a

nonentity'. —— ‘The Non-Ego is posited by the Ego, and is identical
therewith’. —— ‘We have cognizance of an external world only as a

modification of ourselves3 and is it is as we know it, it is nothing but
this modification’.

To the propounded question, Wyclif's adversaries answered, No.
But the same answer is implied in Locke's philosophy, in the Materialism
of some XVIIIth century thinkers, and in the Empiricism and Positivism
of our own times. Whilst attempting to fix the limits of the human
understanding7 Locke was forced to admit that certain ideas7 if not all,
were mere empty abstractions to which nothing corresponded in the
real world3 and that7 reasoning by their means, however correctly‚ we
were still liable to error⁷ because things may exist otherwise than they
are in our minds. Again7 to assert that all is matter, notwithstanding
our consciousness of the abyss between matter and mind -— what is
this but to say that what we know, how indubitably soever, may never—
theless be false? Things are not as we know them to be. And the
statement (which would destroy Metaphysics if Metaphysics could be
