XL INTRODUCTION.

Reflection is impossible, for we cannot conceive the act knowing itself3
and if we know 3 sels—existent act, distinct from ourselves, it is only by
means of a third act, which itself would have to be known by a fourth,
and so on for ever. — Let me note by the way that those who have
denied the existence 01 3 Subject in modern times have been also
driven to deny that we reflect upon ourselves; we only, in their theory,
seem to do so. - Do these acts depend upon us, or do they not? If
our awareness 01 them has nothing to do with their existence, what sort
01 beings are they? (pp. 27—33). - Wyclif winds up with some disfi-
culties about pain, considered as a mental act or feeling, and bearing
on the punishments 01 Hell and Purgatory‚ which he contends would in

this theory become equal.

Ch. 2 need not be noticed, as it is but a short summary ot the
objections which he solves in the next chapter.

Ch. 3. Wyclif, in his answers, begins by assuming several different
senses in which the word aclion is used, and several different species
01 action. ln the widest or transcenslental sense it may mean the very
essence 013 being, when the latter (God) has no accidents: but in all
other senses it is something accidental to the being which acts
(pp. 38—42). The opponents say: Actions make men good ot· bad; and
what makes men good or bad must be a quality. The answer is that,
not the actions themselves, but their goodness or wickedness, produce
this result. The adversaries point out that whatever changes the state of the
soul must be 3 quality, making it qualis and mental acts belong to this
category. But it is replied that this is true, if by quality we understand
llze soul as thus or llzzts clza7zged,· false, if we would make 01 it a subtle
entity that can exist independently os the soul (pp. 42—45l. Here Wyclif
indulges in a short digression concerning grace, where Ι would note,
in connection with the date 01 the work, a striking combination of
prudence and boldness; prudence, in his confirming himself to deny the
sels-existence 01 graceg boldness in censuring only in the mildest terms
those who in the face of the whole 'l‘homist School‚ assert that grace
is not a real entity. Ibelieve this is now an open question among
Scholastic theologians3 but had Wyclif gone farther than he did, he
would have set many an Oxford divine most bitterly against him
(pp. 45——47). — “If''‚ say the adversaries, “a mental act is not move-

ment, it must be a quality3 and it cannot possibly 'oe a movement''.
