VI AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF’S PHILOSOPHICA L SYSTEM.

So great a fall from such a height does not in the least imply
that Wyclif, whether in the past or now, has met with more or with
less attention than he deserved. He was a man of his time, great in his
generation: but changing times have not only taken away all savour of
actuality from the work he did and the problems which he tried to solve3
they have rendered him unintelligible both to the general public and to
those who are not ignorant of philosophy. Out ofa thousand men trained
in modern Metaphysical lore, scarcely one would be able to read and
understand the five volumes of Wyclif’s philosophical works that have
lately seen the light3 and not many would care to peruse the Introductions
and side-notes in which the editors have striven to set forth Wyclif's
meaning. Not only the problems which interested his contemporaries are
dead, but the methods and the very terminology by which he attempted
their solution are dead likewise. And to all such as are not philosophers,
these volumes are no better than waste paper. On looking through
them — if respect for the name of the great forgotten one kept back
some very natural expression of contempt — they surely would experience
something of what the Arab may feel⁷ when he pitches his goat-skin
tent on the ruins of some vast city: “1 wonder how anyone could under-
take such gigantic and such useless work!'’

Assuming that the reader who opens this volume is likely to ex-
perience some such feeling, and yet is willing to be interested in Wyclif’s
philosophy, if possible, my task is a very simple, though, it must be con-
fessed, a very arduous one. Ι intend to state, as plainly as I can, and
putting aside all technicalities that are not indispensable, the main features
of Wyclif’s system, as I have understood it. I shall strive to take his
own point of view3 and though I need hardly say that it is not mine,
will do my utmost to place it in the best and, most convincing light, so
that the reader may at least vaguely understand how it was that he
possessed such influence over his contemporaries3 and also how his
mind, working from point to point, from first principles to ultimate in-
ferences, brought him finally into conflict -— unwilling conflict, as Ι
believe — with more than one dogma of the Church. Here, and with
the purpose stated, Ι hold a brief for Wyclif.

What was that Nominalism in which our philosopher (as he tells
us himself) was bred, from which he broke away early in his career,
and which he afterward fought with such energy during the whole of
