XII ΑΝ Ε55ΛΥ ΟΝ WYCLIF’S PHihosopnlcpiL sYsTEM.

early followers of that line of thought fell into a trap which he avoids
with consummate skill. ‘1f,' argued their adversaries, ‘Humanity be identical
with Smith, and that san-ze Humanity be identical with Brown -— then
Smith and Brown are identical! Two things, the same as a third, cannot
but be the same as each other’. This was granted by certain Realists
of old times, who averred that the distinction between two men was
only apparent, they being essentially identical. More closely pressed‚ they
were forced to admit that all animals, all living things, and finally all
beings‚ were one and the same. Thus they not only fell into Pantheism
-—— which in our days of free thought has not all the practical con-
sequences which it had then — but they confused all things together,
thus annihilating science and law no less completely than did those that
held the contrary view,

Wyclif was not to be caught in this way. He laughs to scorn the
argument brought forward. It is, he says, not a syllogiffln, but 3 monstrous
paralogism. What do you mean by ‘Humanity is identical with Brown?'
Humanity in itself is identical with nothing but itself. Humanity‚ as in
Bromu, is identical with that gentleman. Granted. Humanity, as in Smitlz7
is identical with Smith. Very well. But here you have two different ideas,
instead of one ‘middle term'. You point first to Humanity in one man,
then to Humanity in another: this change in your point of view is
quite sufficient to ruin the argument. I am poor from a millionaire’s
point of view3 Ι am rich, from a pauper's: therefore Ι am both rich
and poor! Anything could be proved7 if we were allowed to pro-
ceed thus.

We must never forget that, though each singular is its Universal
to some extent, and so is that which every other is, still each is different
from every other. To strengthen this position, Wyclif lays great stress
on the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation, which serve to
illustrate his doctrine. What the Father is, is the Son, is the Holy Spirit.
Yet the Father is not the Son, nor is the Spirit the Father. Christ is
God and man at onceg but His Deity is not His human nature. Such
illustrations must, in those days of saith, have rendered him incalculable
service. But, setting them aside, let us choose a few instances in the
purely natural field. The Union Jack is something that is at once red,
white. and blue: but the red is not the white, nor is the blue the red.
The same man may be a mathematician and a drunkard: but his being
