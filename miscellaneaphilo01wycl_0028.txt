doubted3 at all events they understood that the substance of the bread
remained, and was the figure of Christ‘s body. Into the justice of the
sentence Ι need not enter, being only anxious to show that our philosopher
was neither inconsistent nor a coward3 that his assertions harmonize
from his own point of view with one another, and were merely the
frank statement of his matured thought.

But Wyclif did not at the outset see the necessary consequences
to which his system led. At first he saw nothing to hinder him from
maintaining the general opinion of the School, as above set forth. Later,
when he still admitted the possibility os annihilation, he held that the
subtle reality of space existed where that which previously was bread
had ceased to be3 a corpus mathematicum, miraculously sustaining the
accidents of shape‚ colour‚ resistance‚ etc. In the course of discussion,
it dawned upon him that space, to be consistent with his own view,
could no more exist independently of the matter which occupies it than
the shape of a waxen ball can remain when the ball is destroyed.
Whilst yet uncertain, and inclined to think that the subject of the
remaining accidents was mere entity⁷ or an essence concerning the
nature of which ‘he is not curious to enquire'‚ he entered the third
stage, as shown in a most instructive passage of De Benedicta Incar-
natione. And at last, deciding that matter cannot be annihilated, he came
to the irrevocable conclusion that ‘what we see, is bread3 what we
adore, is Christ's Sacramental Body’.

Ι shall possibly be expected to draw a parallel here between
Wyclif and Luther, But there is no parallel to draw, Luther may from
other points of view have been far superior to Wyclif3 as a philosopher,
he is nowhere beside him. What attempts at metaphysical reasoning are
to be found in his works clearly proceed from the necessity to buttress up
some newly built theological doctrine. Wyclif's theology is the reverseg it is
mostly the mere outcome of his metaphysical creed. Wyclif was above
all a logician3 few great men have been so illogical as Luther, And whereas
Wyclif approached the door of exit from the Church with slow reluctant
steps, urged onwards by necessity gradually made clear to him7 Luther,
exasperated by opposition as much as by abuses, went over the threshold
in a few great strides. One was a philosopher; the other was not.

Having stated at the outset that Ι personally (lo not agree with
