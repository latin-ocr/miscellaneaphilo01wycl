INTRODUCTION. XXXVII

apprehend one instant ot what is not present, why not the whole of the
Past and the Future? To each successive impression an act must corre-
spond3 and thus, in the shortest possible space of time, we should have
an infinite multitude of acts. This brings us to the second answer, which
is worth no more than the first. There can be no act without a certain
duration7 and these would have none at all. On the other hand, we
should have to conceive the absurdity of an infinite number of entities⁷
perfectionS‚ — call them what you will, —- welling up (from non-
existence, or from the unknown, in the theory of those who deny a
Subject3 from the Soul, in the opinion of Wyclif's opponents) even in
the shortest possible space of time. This is contrary to experience
besides3 our mental acts of sensation have some degree of permanence,
for When we whirl a brand, we see a circle. To suppose two simul-
taneous acts, one successive and the other permanent, apprehending the
first? does not solve the difficulty: for an instantaneous act cannot feel
the successive as successive, and a permanent act, being of another
nature, could not apprehend it at all (pp. 10—14). Most of these
arguments make against such theories as, at the present day, fearing to
liypostatize an abstract Subject, set up the sensation itself and hypo-
statize it. Perhaps I may in this connection be allowed to quote from
a paper Ι wrote for the Aristotelian Society (Exlevsion as defined from
tlte slandpoiut of experienm read the §8¹¹¹ May, 1900). “tlolding, as Ι
do, most strongly to the principle that abstractions are not to be ‘hypo-
statized', I say that each of these facts [of experience]‚ as such, is
absolutely concrete7 or (to use a dialectical term) singular. So much so,
that if we do not admit the existence of a concrete -— not an abstract ——
subject with which they form a whole, they must be dealt with as separate
individuals. But Ι as stroneg object to the hypostatizing of an abstract
fact as to the hypostatizing osan abstract subject. There is no such
thing in reality as α conscious state3 there are only this, that, and the
other conscious states7 each wholly identical with itself, and not identical
with anything else . . . , . But they are not uncounected. Now, ifI abstract
from this connection7 if I disregard the fact that these impressions are
part of a [olum of experience, I only view them from one standpoint3
and if I then persist in calling them individuals‚ I hypostatize pure
abstractions of my mind. They are no longer individuzds, so long as

I abstract from anything that they really are”. This is the very thing
