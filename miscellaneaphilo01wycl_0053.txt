INTRODUCTION. XLV

quality in the opponents' sense, he now argues that in that sense there
is no such thing. It is⁷ we must remember‚ an accident capable (at least
by God's powerl of existing separately from its substance. Wyclif very
guardedly refrains from saying that quantity or the ‘vis extensiva sub-
stantia’, cannot exist alone. This was generally admitted at the time by
Schoolmen. though, as I have pointed out in De Apostasia7 it forms no
part of the doctrine of the Church of Rome. On the other hand, most
Schoolmen admitted that material qualities, such as colour, taste, weight, ἃς.
were absolutely dependent upon the quantity of a substance, and could
not be conceived apart therefrom. It was thus a doctrine which, to say
the least, was very far from being unassailable: but he attacks it with ar-
guments that are⁷ most of them at least, quite as adaptable to quantity3
in fact, some of them were used by Descartes when he (lenied the theory
of absolute accidents’. But it is certain that an open attack would have
raised a storm which Wyclif probably did not at the time feel it his
duty to meet3 and thus (possibly, as Ι have already said, in view
os the Mastership at Balliol College) he preferred to employ argu-
ments which attacked quantity as an absolute accident without ever
naming it„

Some accidents —— relations, for instance —— are inconceivable as
existing apart from substance. This essential distinction must be common
to all. An accident existing separately would become a substance: which
is impossible„ If it could exist alone, and consequently act alone, it would
be more perfect than material substances, which cannot act but by means
of their qualities. Substance is defined as that which underlies accidents.
Now, if a quality could act by itself‚ it could by itself be also acted
upon and modified, receive movement, &Q — that is, underlie accidents,
and thus become a substance. The whole world might be made up of
absolute accidents, and the idea of substance thus becomes superfluousg
we could not distinguish between things and appearances, and appear-
ances would be to us as things. If this, for instance, were extended to
mental acts, there might be a sensation of whiteness that could perceive
a white colour⁷ without any person to feel it (pp. 116—121). Here
Wyclif examines the adversaries⁷ reply. They naturally fall back upon a
miracle, saying that an accident never has power to exist by itself; it
would, in such ,a case, be upheld by Divine omnipotence. We infallibly

know that substances underlie appearances, unless there be a miracle3
