XXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

which Wyclif so strongly inveighed against in the doctrine of mental
acts, considered to be absolute entities, distinct from the mind.

Wyclif goes on to prove the absurdity of the hypothesis of mental
acts existing independently. Sight‚ for instance, depends upon its object3
:md this dependence renders it necessary that it should exist in a subject.
We have one same sight of different objects3 and this could not be,
given the aforesaid dependence, were there not something underlying
sight. We also see two things as different, though in the same place,
as a glass and that which we see through it, but more or less distinctly3
this again is inexplicaffle, if the sight of each is a separate thing. And
to maintain such a theory we must posit utter Materialism‚ each act
occupying a different part of space, — even the acts of reason and of
will (pp. 14—16). But as a fact, we have an inextended element, even
in the acts of external sense, of presentation; much more so in the others,
Even intensive parts of sensation would be impossible in the opponents’
theory3 for, waiving other objections, to each point of space seen would
correspond a certain intensity of sensation3 and these being infinite, the
total intensity would be so likewise! But an act, because it is elicited
in matter, need not therefore be material. The colours as seen, -— i. e.
the act of sight, -— do not exist in the external thing (pp. 16—18)·,
and this false idea, which Locke was later to ascribe to Scholasficism,
is here set aside by Wyclif in a few words, as a theory that no one
believed, —- the absurdum to which he strove to reduce his adversaries,
Yet there are many who are still convineed at the present day that
Locke was the first man who overthrew the doctrine that colom-s exist
in the things, not in the eye! lf he was, he was also the first reasonable
philosopher that ever lived, and all those before him were fools.

There is no doubt whatever that our act of sensation is what we
can know best, it being our direct experience. If it were a separate
entity‚ it would be, not only most knowable, but most known: and this
is certainly false, or the devil — and this no theologian can admit —
would know our thoughts better than any material substance, which
exists by itself. The whole theory depends upon the doctrine of accidents
in the Eucharist; if material accidents can be absolute, so can mental
acts. But what exists by itself can act by itself3 and it is certain that
our mental acts have influence upon the course of things, which influence
ought to remain) if they were cut off from their subjects (p. 18—20). -—
