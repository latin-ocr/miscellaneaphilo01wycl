lt will scarce be necessary to state in conclusion, that I have found
the work 01 editing this treatise 11111611 facilitated by the number of MSS.
111111 consequent corrective variants. Α5 to their respective value, it would
naturally he supposed that the Stoekholm MS. generally, and it seems with
sufficient reason, supposed to have been written by John Η1155, 15 the best.
Yet much of course (lepended upon the MSS. at his disposa13 and if he
was born in 1373 and the date 01 the MS. is really 1398, he must have
been too young to venture to correct anyln1t1‚)alpal)le errors in the text
he copied. This will account, no doubt, 101· several mistakes which the
other MSS. correct. 1⁴3 [Pi-ag. Unix'. IV H. 9) seems to be a very good

aster all the others, and usually only helps to hear ont readings which
are evidently better than the Stoekholm MS. I was obliged to collate the
latter part somewhat rapidly (See Note, p. 177).

(2). Authenticity and Date of the Work.

Shirley gives us, to prore the authenticity 01 the work, the testimony
01 Bishop Bale, and the author's name 011 MSS. 8. G. 23 and 5 H. 163
to which we must add 1115 11111116 at the ending 01 this tractate in the Stock-
holm manuscript. And though Bale, by Shirley's own admission is ‘careless
and uncritical’‚ and the author's name 011 11 manuscript (1065 not prove
much, still, taken together with other proofs, they seem here conclusive.
Wyclif's style and manner 01 writing 15 as marked in this tractate as in
any other of his best known works. His desire to ‘base philosophy upon
Scripture', clearly shown in his Logiccz, is here realized by a very great
number of texts, almost as numerous indeed as those we 111111 111 the theo-
logical works, The authors from whom Wyelif quotes hy preference are
the same in this treatise3 and Grosseteste, whom he constantly refers to —

in fact, I believe, few long· tractates are without some extract from this
