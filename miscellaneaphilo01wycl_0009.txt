An Essay on Wyclif’s Philosophieal System.

After the publication, by the Wyclif Society, of De Compositione
Hominis, of De Ente Praedicamentali, and of the three volumes of Logica,
lately issued, enough is now known of this philosopher's general system
and trend of thought to render a synopsis of his philosophy quite possible.
This synopsis appears to be particularly in its place at the beginning of
the works now to be pubhshed, in which he develops his principles
more elaborately and in »greater detail. Nor can we doubt that the
· synthesis of what has already appeared will be of use for what is to
come — for the two volumes of Miscellanea. and for those, much more
numerouS‚ of Wyclifs great work, De Enle.

The words of Isaiah in the Revised Version: ‘How art thou fallen
from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning!' can alone adequately
render the extremes'of Wyclif’s fate: world-wide celebrity in his own
timechomplete oblivion in ours. The man who devoted his life to
stemming the then all but irresistible tide of Nominalistic philosophy3
whose subtle genius drew to him at Oxford a numerous and enthusiastic
band of followers, who in the first years of his Mastership at Balliol
Hall elaborated a system of philosophy perhaps more daring than that
of any Englishman before him, certainly as comprehensive and as surely
following from his first principles as any, whether before him or after3
who, driven step by step towards the natural conclusions of his system,
was the first to rise up against Rome, and to inaugurate the movement
wh’rch culminated in Huss, and ended with Ziska: -— that man is now
so utterly forgotten; what he may or may not have thought is so ab·
solutely indifferent even to cultured minds in the present day, that his
Latin works, now being published by the Wyclif Society sor upwards of

fifteen years, are almost unread in his own native country.
