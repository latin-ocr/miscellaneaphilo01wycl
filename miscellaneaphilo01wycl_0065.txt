INTRODUCTION. LVII

nevertheless generally mentions by a still more honorable title, “Venerabilis
Inceptor'’. Or it may even be that he refers directly to Augustine (cf.
Lechler: Johann v. Wiclif und die Vorgeschichte der Reformation I, p. 4613
ΙΙ, p. 610). Dudik furtherinore seeks support for the claim of Huss in
the fact that we find no omissions in the Manuscript of this treatise7 as
we do for instance in No. I, as well as in the comparatively rare cor-
rections which here occur. But when we consider how short this treatise
is, covering as it does only nine leaves, this state of things seems by
no means remarkable. For corrections do occur, and among the other
treatises one could easily find a long series of pages entirely wanting
in omissions.

The course of my investigation has therefore led me to the con-
clusion that the authorship of the four longer treatises contained in the
Stockholm MS. may be attributed to Wyclif with an amount of probability
which is all but equivalent to certainty, while with regard to the short
summary, entitled “Replicacio de universalibus”7 it is quite credible that
it is due to his hand as well.

The words of the text “per manus Hus de Hussynetz” will then
refer merely to the actual writer. That Huss with his own hand wrote
at least the greater part, if not the whole, of this Manuscript, seems
highly probable. The Bohemian works and phrases which occur point
to a writer to whom this language was familiar.1 Furthermore, Dr. Dudik
sent through Professor Dr. Kolenati two facsimile passages out of this
Manuscript to Herr Hanka of Prague, where Huss' original writings are
preserved. One of these passages happened to be a part of the first
treatise in which the words “haha czechu'' seems to have been written
by a different hand from the Manuscript itself (Cap. 10, see Appendix).
Mr. Hanka declared the whole Manuscript to be the work of Huss (of
course with the exception of certain additions, corrections &o which are
undoubtedly of later date). A fresh comparison between facsimiles from

other parts of this codex and the originals of Huss at Prague ought to
finally settle this question.

1 According to Dud1k, these occasional Behemian words were probably inserted
only to fill up the lines (aeine damalige Modesache³³)‚ and are quite without bearing
on the text. But. an expression like that which we find on leaf 43 (see Appendix),
as well as one on leaf 51, has at least some connexion with the text.
