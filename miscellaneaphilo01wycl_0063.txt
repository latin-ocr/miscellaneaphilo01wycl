INTRODUCTION. LV

vvird der Schluss: dass Huss kaum der Verfasser dieser Abhandlung sei,
ein verzeihlicher.⁷' To this there are some points of evidence to be
added, which though they provide no infallible testimony, nevertheless
tend strongly in favour of Wyclil's authorship of this particular treatise,
evidence too which clearly cannot have been known to Dudik, Stephens
and Peeirka, because it is only the research of recent years which has
brought it to light. I mean first of all the relations which existed in a
general way between Huss and Wyclif. There is no doubt that these
latest investigations have gone to show tl refer especially to Loserth’s
work “Huss and Wiclif” which marks an era in our knowledge), how
intimate this association was, how Huss even in his maturest manhood
never broke his close and pupil-like connexion with his English master.
And as it has been made clear that in the work of his riper years he
almost mechanically adopted, nay to a great degree simply reproduced
in writing‚ the spoken utterances of Wyclif‚ are we not justified in
supposing that in his youth Huss held a position of even less independence
with respect to his admired teacher, and especially in regard to speculative
work which called for a greater experience of life and maturity than he
himself possessed?

Another circumstance which tends in the same direction is that in
the List which Loserth gives of Wyclif⁷s writings that were burnt twelve
years later tin 1410) by the order of Archbishop Zbinco on account of
their reputed heretical tendencies, four out of the five treatises of the
Stockholm Manuscript occurs. The only one which is not among them
is the “Replicacio de universalibus'', the very treatise in fact which Dudik
maintains was undoubtedly written by Huss, though for my part Ι am
for certain reasons inclined to doubt even this.

The fact that Archbishop Zbinco caused to be burned one or
more copies of treatises by Wyclif bearing the same name is of course
no real proof that he is the author of the Stockholm treatise ‘de Ydeis'.
This can evidently only be decided by an accurate comparison between
the original of the copy or copies which were consigned to the flames,
and that which we have at Stockholm. But the fact above referred to
goes at least to support the plausibility of the supposition that Huss did
not write No. 2 ‘de Ydeis’.1 In Prokop v. Pilsen’s speech in defence of

¹ Loserth's list of the burnt xvritings also makes it probable that Wyclif was
the author of “De veris univcrsalibus³³.
