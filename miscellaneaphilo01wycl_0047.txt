lNTRODUCTlON. XXXIX

Note here with what care Wyclif, though he points out that the whole
theory springs from the question of the Eucharist (ex quibus tota illa
opinio habet ortum, p. 16), avoids any such digression as he is liable
to in other tractatos, concerning the Eucharist itself: this reticence is Of
importancc in seeking the date of the work.

Starting froin the Scholastic axiom: Omne ens est boumn, or Ens
et bonum converlrmlm‘, Wy‹-lif tries to prove that, as some mental acts
are essentially evil⁷ they cannot be cntities, Pain is nothing in itself but
the perception of disagrccincnt‚ which is nothing positive3 and lying is
essentially evil (pp. 20, 21). The adversaries reply that such acts are
not naturally, but only morsilly bad: and if a given act did not belong
to a subject, its wickedness would disappear. But if they, belonging to
a subject, render that subject evil, it must needs be because their nature
is bad. Α point that Wyclif does not develop here, is that qualities
which affect the will are essentially either moral or immoral, and the
distinction between moral and natural badness does not hold in their
case. Now the adversaries held that the same act, elicited by one man,
may be moral, and immoral if elicited by another, so that this is a
mere accident, But, says VVyclis, what about an act of hatretl of God?
Can God Himself attach merit to that? And besides, the supposition of
an act elicited by no one (not belonging to any subject), of a pain that
is actual yet suffered by nobody, of something which exists as a pure
potentiality and like a habit -- as V. g. a man may actually be a
drunkard, though not actually drunk — and yet is an act, are so many
absurdities. A mental act significs something clicited by a subject, or
we should have an endless series of entities by which the act is pro-
duced, one producing the other, and none of them really active. And
lastly, the supposition os an act that may be inactive, or ouly potentially
active, is utterly confusing; such an act might possibly exist before the
man who elicits it is born (pp. 21 ρ27).

The following arguments may be more summarily indicated, as
presenting less actual interest in our time; and I shall throughout attempt
to keep to this rule, as the side-notes are sufficiently explicit to help
any one interestetl in old-world modes of thought,

Self-existence is contradicted by the essential attributes, at least of
some mental acts. Some may be contingently false or contingently true3
but if false or ‘true by themselves, they would be so necessarily.
