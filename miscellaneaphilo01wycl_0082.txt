LXXIV INTRODUCTION.

the wax to the 13110111. And throughout all these changes 01 external
qualities, something 1611131113 unchanged3 and that something must therefore
be itself absolutely indeterminate, but capable of receiving any determination.
This was Prima] Matter3 and its determinations -— such at least as made
it pass from one class Of substance to another -- were called Substantial
Forms. Every stone. every plant, every animal, every man, was merely
primal matter plus a substantial form of its own. These were not merely
two names for the same thing, or the same thing· from two points of
view. To be defermined and [0 dele-rulime, to receive and lo give, are not
only different, but incompatible attributes. What gives “waxness”, though
not really distinct from wax, must be distinct from that which, from not
wax, becomes wax, or in 011161· words receives “waxness’‘.

Thus primal matter and substantial form are the two really different
elements into which we must 1630116 everything that is subject 10 sub-
stantial change. Matter can in no case subsist without form, since it has
no quality but receptibility of form, and even that is 3 purely passive
quality. All the lower forms os which the actix’ity 13 311611 11131 11 cannot
take place without matter, cease 10 exist so soon as another sorm takes
their place3 a form either actually informs matter or (lisappears altogether.
When the (laisy 131163, when the l‚›utterssy or the nightingale 11163, 111611
forms —- their 3011Ῐ3, 111 Scholastic language —— cease to be. In 111311 alone⁷
the form, which is the sou]⁷ “that by which the body is 3 lix-ing human
body‘'⁷ has 3 distinct activity which does not depend upon matter; and
therefore7 when separated, though it is no longer actually 3 form, it need
not cease to exist.

Such is the ordinary doctrine of the School, in which we must
notice the appeal to the fact of change for the positing of the two
elements‚ and to the principle of contrariety to prove their distinction from
each other. The thing is matter⁷ partly; it is partly form; but also it is
partly not one, and partly not the other, since each are different. Yet they
are both identical in space·7 where 0116 13, there 13 1116 other: form pei-vades
matter, matter upholds form. This doctrine is not so absurd as some may
think. In the XVIIth century, Leibnitz had a return towards the end
of his career 10 11113 old theory which he somewhere says “has a great
deal of truth in it‘'; and even in our days a great many Neo—Scholastic
philosophers have elaborated a theory of Matter and Form, {dentical in

its essentials with the ancient one, but strictly agreeing with the data os
