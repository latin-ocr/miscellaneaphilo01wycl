wreck thought, the whirlpools which engulf it: but we philosophical
mariners will not be advised‚ and every one steers for the rocks to
keep clear of the whirlpool‚ or for the whirlpool to avoid the rocks.
Or, to revert to our former illustration‚ suppose a set oflooking-glasses
endowed with human faculties‚ longing to get at the things they
represent. One of them might cry: “There is no room save the room
which Ι mirror within me3 for the reflection is the room, and the
reflection is identical with me’', And another: “Reflection proceeds from
outside, its cause cannot be within me: and therefore it were impossible
to judge whether what I mirror has any likeness at all with the room,
unless I could get out 01 ῐηγςε]1”. The former would end by denying
3 separate existence to the room, the latter by refusing to believe
anything at all about it, In like manner do these two contrary trends 01
thought proceed, some philosophers going farther‚ others not so far, but
always in two contrary directions, and both fiercely intolerant 01 so tarne
a middle course as that which has been sketched above. Wyclif belonged
to the former, and these at least maintain the character and the value
of human knowledge3 their excesses and errors at least do not attack
the foundations 01 thought. But the others, whatever their ingenuity and
acumen in minor matters may be, strike by the very force 01 their first
principle at the roots of the human understanding and of all truth, and
their genius does but stultify itself. Against this tendency, very powerful
in his time, Wyclif's system was 3 reaction3 as such, it was certainly

justified3 and if, like all reacffions, it went too far, it has at least 3 claim
to be judged with leniency.
