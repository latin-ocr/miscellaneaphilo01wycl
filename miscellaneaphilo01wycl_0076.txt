LXVIII INTRODUCTION.

really include its singular, as it must by its universal nature. The underlying
question is whether, if you allow that the Universal has a separate
existence of its own, independent of any one of its singulars, you are able
to count the Universal and its singular separately as two. Not only you
are able, but you must; but if so, you have two singulars, one of which
is not the other. And this must⁷ in the system of Real Universals, be
denied: the Universal and its singular are one. How then can one include
the other? This is a palpable hit, and Wyclif does not affect to make
light of it. He admits that the argument is well put and seemingly conclusive,
but ‘provisionally' (quo ad presens) denies the conclusion. And further,
on p. 1447 we see him in the mes-hes of a similar difficulty, first admitting
the conclusion that ‘the existence of one thing may be that of another‘‚
and then adding — as an after-thought, his opponent maliciously remarks
— a distinction against which there is a strong and apparently unans-
werable argument. Oi course this is the crux ot the matter. Give the
Universal Humanity7 Animation —— what you will —— only ideal existence,
and the difficulty disappears. The problem is how to think them as real
things, other than their singulars, yet identical with them3 and if other,
then singulars or units which can be counted; and yet universal. However
great Wyclif’s philosophical acumen may have been, it is no wonder if
he floundered about a little just in this place. We may leave him so:
this review of the two most interesting parts in the debate will, I think,
suffice in lieu of the detailed contents of so short a treatise.

(1). The Manuscripts.

Of this work there are no fewer than seven manuscripts extant.
Shirley gives six of them in his catalogue3 the seventh is the Stockholm
MS„ written by Huss in all probability, ancl for that reason taken as text.
Of the others, Ι omitted collating Prag. Univ. 8. G. 23 and 5. H. 16,
because, having looked over thern, I thought their variants of little
importance to the text, and in most cases concurring with those already
noted, except where they gave blunders of their own. I need not say that
this step was only taken with the full concurrence of Dr Furnivall.
Lundstrom's Introduction gives a very complete description of the Stock-
