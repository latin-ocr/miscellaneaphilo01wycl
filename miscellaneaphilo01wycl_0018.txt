XIV AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF'S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.

And the truth‚ known everlastingly by God, and the truth, known by
Wyclif now, and that which exists in the things themselves, are one and
the same: That They Are! All things, from first to last, are foreknown
by God as existing3 were they not thus soreknown, they would neither
take place, nor could they be possible. —— The sun sets, and the crimson
clouds are fair to see; but Wyelif’s mind still contemplates the eternal
existence of their beauty in God, when, a few minutes later, darkness
comes over the land, and he must needs return to his cell to ponder,
his heart full of these things.

This, however, is a mere sketch of Wyclif’s system, as it was
then budding in his mind: we must now see how he afterwards developed
and elaborated it in his Logica, giving us a complete and most original
Cosmological theory. It is, however, necessary to the right understanding
of what will follow, that we should note several corollaries and minor
issues that proceed by logical sequence from his fundamental principles,
once laid down.

Nominalists readily admitted that, whilst the number of existing
singulars must be finite (for an innumerable number is absurd) that of
things merely possible, which from their point of view were only fictions
without reality, might be infinitely, or — if you prefer —- indefinitely
great. So might also possible space be indefinite in size, and for ever
divisible into indefinitely smaller and smaller parts. So likewise of time.
But for Wyclif, whatever is possible is really possible, and therefore
real; and for him too an innumerable number was an absurdity. Realities,
countless to our mincis, may and do exist3 but nothing is infinite to God
— not even Himself. The number of these realities is therefore fixed
and definite. A being that God might but never will create is a contra-
diction in terms3 since its cause -— God’s will —— is wanting, it would
be something without a cause, no less impossible than coal-black
whiteness. The total multitude of possible beings is all those which God
eternally sees as existing at some period of time: and no others. This
is the maximum number, and the minimum at the same time. Space, to
us unlimited‚ is limited in God's sight3 there is also a limit to its
possible divisions, and the smallest possible part of space - the mathe-
matical point — is an existing reality. Again, since space is real, there
can be no vacuum where it exists3 but on the other hand, it is absolutely

unthinkable save as the whereabouts of a body, real, but depending
