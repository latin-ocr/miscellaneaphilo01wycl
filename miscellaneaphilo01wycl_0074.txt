LXVI INTRODUCTION.

ad presens' a consequence which he admitted to be formally right, that
seems to me far different from the tone which Huss would have taken
under similar circumstances. And it certainly seems to me that the writer
is sincere in his attempts to make Wyclif contradict himselfg nay, even
in his belief that he has succeeded. Who he may have been, if not Huss,
is a question of less importance: possibly some young Dominican or
Franciscan friar who, being well skilled in the mental fencing that such
a (lebate required, had challenged Wyclif to a public controversy, and
afterwards wrote a short account of it. That the account was fair enough,
and contained an impartial statement of both sides of the question, would
be a sufficient reason for its being copied by Huss, to whom we may
perhaps ascribe the closing words in which he shows that, in his opinion,
Wyclif had the best of the argument, and his adversary was only able
to proceed by ‘extraneis cavillacionibus'. This view of the matter also
clearly explains the reason why this treatise was not burnt by Archbishop
Zbinca, as LundstrOm tells us — and also why it passed as a work of
Wyclif3 which it indeed is in part, as much as the stenographie report of
a debate between Gladstone and Beaconsfield may be counted among the
works of either.

A few words now as to the date. It is of course —— since Wyclif
is designated as ‘Magister’ —— sufficiently fixed one way. But whether it
be anterior to Logica and De Actibus it is impossible to say with any
certitude. If De Actibus was anterior to Wyclif's Mastership‚ the conclusion
is obvious3 but we have seen that this is not at all sure. The greater
development of Wyclif’s arguments and lines of reasoning in Logica might
lead us to think the Replicalio was written before it3 but as it is, in all
probability, only a report and a summai-y of a (lebate that seems to have
really taken place, the proof falls to the ground, or at any rate is merely
negative. There is nothing whatever to show that the debate took place
after Logica was finished; but even that hypothesis is not improbable.

properly speaking, the analysis of what is in itself the dryest and
most succinet analysis — the skeleton of an skeleton, if such an expression
may be allowed -— were a task beyond the power of man. ΤΟ follow
the discussion properly, the whole of the tractate, or at least the whole
