LVIII INTRODUCTION.

Stephens’, assertion⁷ adopted by Dudik‚ that the treatises bearing
Wyclif’s name, Nos. Ι, III and V, were unknown and unprinted, now
only holds good in part² Dudik himself of course helped to make their
existence known to the learned world. Nos. V and III, “De universalibus''
and “De materia et forma’' are in Shirley's list of Wyclif's original works,
though 116 omits “De individuacione temporis et instantis”. (Although
Shirley⁷s catalogue dates from 1865 and Dudik’s “Forschungen &C.⁷'
from 1851, the latter's work was not turned to account by the former.)
Since Lechler's time they have been included in all works upon Wyclif
which have any pretence to completeness. It will be remembered from
what has been said above that three treatises bearing the same names
as these three were among the works burned on July 16⁸¹, 1410. Very
soon after this remarkable day, disputations were delivered at the University
of Prague in defence of this very treatise “De universalibus’' by Idislaw
v. Zwinzeticz⁷ and “De materia et forma” by Johann v, Giezin.

But to a certain extent the dictum of Stephens and Dudik above
mentioned still holds good. It is a most remarkable fact that not even
at this day is there a single one of Wyclif's philosophical works in
print.I And this circumstance is all the more notable‚ when one remembers
what a reputation for acumen and dialectical ability he enjoyed among
his contemporaries as well as with posterity,‘3 since we often find “Subtilis
vir”‚ “Subtilis magister'' applied to the English reformer.

Latterly‚ however, great interest has been awakened both in the
man and his works. The real impulse seems to have been due to Pro-
fessor Walter Waddington Shirley of Oxford, who died in 1866. Of his
excellent “Catalogue” I have already spoken; and besides this he published
another work of great importance for the subject, “Fasciculi Zizaniorum''.
In 1880, Wyclif's works in English were given to the public, but these
are inconsiderable both in value and extent, compared with his Latin
writings. In March 1882 the Wyclif Society was founded 111 England for
the purpose of editing and publishing Wyclif's still unprinted Latin works,

scientific ability aud importance so highly as his contemporaries, or 33 116 (1636111611
