LVI INTRODUCTION.

this burnt treaffise, it is expressly mentioned that it consisted of five
Chapters, which also agrees with that which forms part of the Stockholm
Manuscript (see Loserth‚ “Huss and Wiclif⁷’, p. 282).

Recent investigations in England have shown that these writings
which have hitherto been looked upon as mutually independent‚ viz.
‘De ‘tempore' (Ξ de indiv. temp), and ‘De Ydeis',¹ only form a part of
Wyclif's great treatise ‘De Ente’.

‘De ‘tempore’ is in fact ξ 6 of Work Ι, and ‘De Ydeis' ἓ 5 of
Work ΙΙ of ‘De Ente⁷. <This I owe to Dr. Furnivall and the Report of
the Executive Committee.)

We now coine to the question of the authorship of No. IV, “Repli-
cacio de universalibus’'‚ which is also supposed by Dudik to be the
work of Huss. I must begin by observing that I consider Dudik's suppo-
sition altogether doubtful. Both Shirley, in his “Catalogue of the original
works of John Wielif³⁷ and⁷ following him7 Lechler in his great work
“Johann v. Wiclif und die Vorgeschichte der Reformation'’ and Vattier
in “John Wyclyff, sa vie, ses oeuvres, sa doctrine”7 mention a treatise
with this very title. ‘RepL de univ.' as one of Wyclif's original works
(No. 9 of the philosophieal writings in Shirley, No. 6 in Lechler and
Vattier). It is in the MS. ΝΟ. 10 in the University Library at Prag⁷ but
as2 Ihave had no opportunity of comparing it with that at Stockholm,
I cannot of course at present offer a decisive opinion on the subject.
But so much at least must be plain, that it is by no means certain that
Huss was the author. Dudik advances in support of his view the occur-
rence here and there in this treatise of the expressions “Magister meus
reverendus’' and ttMagister meus”.

But these expressions might very well have been Wyelif’s own,
and might refer to some of those men whom he valued as his Mamers,
as for instance, the Parisian teacher Henrik Gothals of Ghent -ξ- 1293
(Henrikus de Gauda-0, Doctor solemnisl, Johann v. Jaudun († c, 13291,
Walter Burleigh († 1337), who may all be considered as Wyclif’s fore-
runners in the exposition of a Platonising Augustinian Realism‚ and to
all of whom, at various places in his writings‚ he appeals. Perhaps too
the expressions in question might refer to William Occam, whom Wyclif

only at second hand, as his excellent catalogue has not been accessiblc to me.
