LIV INTRODUCTION.

obliterated. The first: “Magistri Johannis Huss unus tractatus de ydeis'’
can still be seen fairly distinctly, but the following “secundus” (according
to Dudik and Stephens) happens to come just on a sold of the parchment3
and was, to me at least, quite indecipherable even with the aid of a
powerful lens. After this word, which we may — on the joint authority
of Dudik and Stephens — take to be “secundus”‚ follow two more,
which are still fairly legible “replicacio universalis''. The third line begins
with a word which seems to me just as likely to be ‘eius’ as tercius,
though perhaps Ι should adopt the latter for preference. Then comes
something illegible which falls just on the above-mentioned fold. That
one of these words is ‘de’ may possibly be admitted, at least by any
one who has been led to expect to see that word there. The upper
part of one letter is quite plain and may well belong to a ‘d‘. The last
word is still legible.

But it is clear that Dudik's statement that both ‘tercius’ and ‘eius’
are to be found here cannot be correct (Stephens reads only ‘eius').
For some trace‚ even if it were illegible, would certainly exist, if a second
word had been written there3 but no such trace is to be seen. After
‘replicacio universalis' these is not a sign of any other word but ‘tercius’
(or eius), and after it we have directly “de veris universalibus”. In these
circumstances it will be safest not to let this old and very obscure anno-
tation have any preponderating influence on the question of the authorship
of any of these treatises.

With regard to the second treatise, Dudik disputes, and I think
with reason, the claim of Huss to its authorship. He summons to the
support of his view, neither the circumstance that this work of Huss has
been hitherto unknown, nor the fact that Lewis in his “History of the
life and opinions of John de Wycliffe” (Oxford 1836) refers to this
treatise as one of Wyclif’s most important works, but bases his contention
on the ground that the omission of words and phrases in this as well
as the other three treatises which are with all reason ascribed to Wyclif‚
implies the unfamiliarity of the writer with the original. This evidence he
thus brings forward: „Wenn man bedenkt‚ dass der Amor, wenn er sein
Concept mundirt⁷ kaurn nothig hat, Worte, die er nicht lesen kann, aus-
zulassen — denn wer soll ihm hieriiber Auskunft ertheilen? Man aber in
