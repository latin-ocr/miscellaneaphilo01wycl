ceptualistic theory. The likeness is then only in the chemist's mind.
What we think of as hydrogen in one jar may in reality have nothing
similar in nature to what we think of as hydrogen in another. We put
them together, we 61333 1116111 under one general idea; but all our
reasonings must necessarily relate, not to them, but to the idea! Between
things and our ideas of things, there is an abySS. Science may tell us
something about the latter; about the former, nothing. Experiments may,
for example, show us that what is in jar No 1 is combustible in exactly
the same way and under the same conditions as what is in jar No 2,
This is therefore a property identical in each case. Yesl but the identity
goes no farther than our minds: they are in fact two different combusti-
bilities‚ and we can affirm nothing about them, everything about our
ideas of them. Let Chemistry‚ Natural Science⁷ Mathematics, all go
to ruin: sor most certainly, when we say, ‘These gases are hydrogen,'
or, ‘These animals are elephants', or, ‘These figures are rectangles’, we
do vot mean only: ‘My idea of gas in this and this case corresponds to
my idea of hydrogen'g nor, ‘The concept of certain animals, A, Β, C...
is included in that of elephants’3 nor, ‘These singulars, which I classify
as figures, may also be classified as rectangles’. No: we mean more;
we say not only that the thoughts, but also the things, have in them-
selves 3 correspondence with each other. But, perish Chemistry, Mathe-
matics, and every science‚ and let Conceptualism prevail! — Can absurdity
go farther?

possibly, 31 16331 11 may become more striking. You deny 111317
when 3 general term is used, anything general is meant beyond the
word itself⁷ or 31 11631, beyond 311 311311361 idea. Very well. Here is 3
111311 who promises to pay five pounds. He is out of 63311 just now, so
he cannot be thinking of any particular coin or banknote in his possession.
What then does he promise? Something identical with, and equivalent
to, any existing sum of five pounds. Is what he promises, only a word?
Is it an abstraction? Then what is his promise worth in either case?
Business men are not likely to think highly of such a theory. And if
you say that he promises to pay certain singulars, without specifying
which, I reply that A singular, Some singulam, All singulam, are
general terms, and fall under the same class 33 the ‘five pounds', and
present the same difficulty. ‘A singular’, not applied in thought to

this or that singular, in your theory either means nothing, or nothing real.
