INTRODUCTION LXV

elusionem . , . universale est sz'ngulczre' &evidently meaning, ”is not a pure
abstraction’sl. Once more we find (p. 1495 the writer’s assertion, and stated
as his own: ‘Nullum universale est'. And here I only give such expressions
are as on the face of them quite umnistakable: but the whole work would
to me at least have no meaning, if we supposed that the writer was
Wyclif, defending the reality of Universals, since every one of his
arguments is directed point-blank aganist them.

But, this being so, what proofs are there that Wyclif was, as I have
said, the ‘Magister’ referred to? what likelihood have we that Huss was
the author of the work? and if not Huss, who may he have been?

To the first question I believe that everybody who knows Wyclifs
line of thought, and studies the arguments giren, will think that no proofs
are required othei· than the tractate itself. Not to speak of De Universalihns,
which has not yet appeared, but which I have had the advantage to see,
we find the Magister's very arguments repeated and developed in Logica,
vol ΙΙ. His point that ‘to be a man’ (hominem esse) is the essence of man,
and that this essence has a universal yet real existence, is to be read in
Log. II. pp. 33—35, as well as in the Replicacio, pp. 133—134. The
difficulties he grapples with about the Universal and its singular forming
a number, are to be found both in Log. pp. 47—53 and in Rep. p. 1363
the ‘Phoenix' difficulty, which he tries to solve in one treatise, occurs in
the other, and is answered in like manner. But really there is no need to
go further3 if anyone who has read Ch. ΙΙ of Logica‚ vol. II, reads the
Replicatio without being conx’inced that the Magister in question was
Wyclif himself (or at least some one holding the very same doctrines),
I do not see by what means he can be convinced,

If we suppose, however, that towards the end of the XIV. century
there existed in Bohemia a ‘Magister‘ whose views and ideas were identical
with those of Wyclif, it is possible that Huss may, as a dialectical exercise,
have taken up the cudgels against him, and argued the question from a
Nominalistic point of view. It has osten happened that men, wishing to
see things more clearly, have tried to reason themselves out of opinions
towards which they had a strong leaning. Still I do not think this at all
probable. There are here and there certain traces of fierceness — almost
of a dialectical scuffle -— that would ill suit such an attitude‚ which
would be but < seigned antagonism after all. There is a quiet

exultation over a temporary embarrassment of the Magister, denying ‘quo
