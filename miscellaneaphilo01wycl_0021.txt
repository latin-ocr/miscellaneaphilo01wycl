AN ESSAY ΟΝ WYCLIF⁷S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM. XVII

all its points taken away from a line, can I maintain that the line is
entire? for it is nothing more than all its pointS, just as the whole is all
its parts. They are thus parts of the line, each touching every other,
yet no two in tlze same place. This is not only not absurd, but necessary·7
each point stands for a certain fixed position in space: mutual contact
cannot destroy their one 6556111131 property. By 3 like reasoning we prove
that 3 surface consists of lines, and that 3 volume is made up of surfaces.
A line, a surface, or a volume that is by hutone point less than another,
is smaller than that other.

Again⁷ suppose that two bodies touch: where they touch, do their
points coincide? [f they did, they could not belong to different bodies,
Two points never can become one, however near: at the 1111111, therefore,
they are 3150 distinct. The surfaces of 311- and water touch. A stone
falls into the water. Will it not first reach the bottoinmost surface of
the air, and the topmost surface of the water afterwards? Each snrface‚
being respectively of air and of water, cannot 136 1116 531116, unless
air be water.

These proofs do not satisfy Wyclif’s antagonistS. In their opinion,
a point, a line, or a surface, is but 311 abstraction (if it be even that);
space itself 15 only 311611011, if taken apart from singulars occupying
space, And 31 any rate a point 15 1101 a part of it3 according to Geometry,
both points, lines and surfaces may and do 6011161116, But how can they
have the face to invoke the authority of Geometry, when their whole
system means the utter destruction of that science? Since 3 11116 15 311
abstractum, how can one be twice 35 great 35 another? You can bisect
a line3 can you cut an abstraction in two? According to us, 0116 11116
15 twice as long 35 another when the multitude of its points is twice 35
great. That number, though no man — possibly no creature —— is able
to count it, exists, and is known to God. Such is our idea, clear and
intelligible3 but what of theirs? If there 136 110 such thing 35 311116, how
can there be, between two lines, either equality or inequality? You
cannot compare two nothingnesses together. If we seem to contradict
Geometry‚ we only seem to do so; whereas your contradiction is open
and flagrant.

The composition os time⁷ which we say consists of succesive in-
divisible instants, is yet more evidently demonstrable, if such a thing

6311 be. Wyclif⁷s opponents say that the end of one state and the
